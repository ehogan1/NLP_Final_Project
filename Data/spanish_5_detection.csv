BlackBerry announced on Wednesday that it will not renew T-Mobile's license to sell its products when it expires on April 25. T-Mobile offended the Canadian phone manufacturer in February when it sent messages to its BlackBerry users with an offer to switch to the iPhone 5s with a $0 down payment. The Seattle-based carrier attempted to make amends with a second promotion, offering BlackBerry users $200 in credit when they traded in their device for any new T-Mobile phone."
