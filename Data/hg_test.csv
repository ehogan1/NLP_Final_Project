"For small businesses that sell on credit, accounts receivable can make up a substantial portion of the balance sheet. During the annual audit, auditors will check to see if your claims regarding the accounts receivable balance can be proved. These claims are known as assertions. The most common audit procedure related to accounts receivable is confirmation, in which the auditor will ask your customers to confirm their account balance. Knowing which assertions can be proved by confirmation can help you understand why your auditor asks for multiple audit procedures on the same account. Accounts receivable confirmations mainly serve to prove the existence assertion.",1

High above Midtown Manhattan, the front-runner in the Republican race for the presidency and the leading woman in prime-time news met to settle a score. Donald Trump and Megyn Kelly, who have spent the better part of the election cycle publicly feuding, privately fuming, or ignoring one another, met at Trump Tower on Monday, seemingly ending the silence between them. “Yes, the doormen appeared a bit stunned when I walked in,” Kelly said on her Fox News show Wednesday night.",1

"PREBLE COUNTY — With two serious crashes involving young people occurring in Preble County over the past week, Preble County Sheriff Mike Simpson discussed summer driving practices as younger, less experienced drivers become more active during the summer. According to Simpson, during the summer roadways often become more active and younger drivers tend to be on the road more because they are no longer in school. “With kids out of school or kids back from college, there a lot more of younger drivers on the roadways going back and forth from events or work now that they aren’t in schools for 6-7 hours a day,” Simpson said.",1

"A CANCER expert has hit on a way to kill tumours in two hours — using light. The technique involves a single jab with a chemical then a flash of ultraviolet. Cancer cells in lab mice were found to self-destruct, with up to 95 per cent dead in two hours. Professor Matthew Gdovin revealed the cells — which he injected with the chemical compound nitrobenzaldehyde — turned too acidic to survive. He said after patenting his “photodynamic” therapy: “There are many different types of cancers. “The one thing they have in common is their susceptibility to this induced cell suicide.",1
"Drones come in a wide variety of different shapes and sizes these days, but generally speaking, most of them still fall within one of two categories. There are those of the multi-rotor variety (quadcopters, hexacopters, octocopters, etc), and those of the winged variety. Both categories have their own set of advantages and disadvantages. Multi-rotor aircraft are typically more stable and easy to fly, but also much slower than wing drones that focus on forward acceleration. Conversely, winged drones can fly faster and further than their hovering counterparts, but are harder to pilot, since they can’t perform vertical takeoffs and landings.",1
"BASEL, Switzerland – Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche Holding AG said Monday that it has had reports of 13 cases the H1N1 flu becoming resistant to Tamiflu, which it calls a very low percentage. A good sign is that the people who had the resistant strain have not passed the disease on to other people, said David Reddy, leader of Roche&apos;s Tamiflu pandemic task force. And the resistant variety has been like the widespread version of the virus in that it typically produces only mild symptoms. The 13 cases were scattered around the world in Europe, the United States and Asia, said Reddy.",1

Speaking in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi on Tuesday before a meeting with Jordan’s King Abdullah, Putin said the downed plane had been attacked inside Syria when it was 1 kilometre from the Turkish border and had come down 4 kilometres inside Syria.

"Did Donald Trump Release Donald Trump’s Tax Return? For a moment, it seemed that Rachel Maddow was in possession of a genuine scoop. And then, all of a sudden, it didn’t….Thanks to MSNBC, the suggestion that Trump has “paid no taxes in 18 years” has now been definitively proven to be false. Moreover, Trump seems to have paid a higher tax rate in 2005 than did most political figures, and to have enjoyed a sizeable income to boot. Whether the report was cherry-picked we cannot possibly know.",1

"There’s a Speed Graphic camera, once standard equipment in newsrooms across the country. You may have seen them in 1930s and ’40s-era movies that featured gaggles of photographers, “Press” placards stuck in there fedora hatbands.

It’s a video camera that shoots full HD color footage in almost complete darkness. The ‘multi-purpose’ camera, dubbed only MH20F-SH, has a full-frame sensor with 2.26 megapixels.

"New research suggests mice with induced Alzheimer’s-like symptoms had improved cognitive function when given a synthetic estrogen-like hormone. “This synthetic hormone improved behavior much the way that estrogen does,” said study leader Dr. Christian Pike, associate professor at the University of Southern California’s School of Gerontology. But unlike estrogen, which enlarges the uterus and is a known risk factor for endometrial and breast cancer, PPT caused no obvious changes to the animals’ reproductive tract. “This may be a promising strategy to maximize hormone therapy benefits and minimize its risk,” said Pike.",1

"To involve private sector in healthcare, what is really required is a heavy increase in public sector investment to reach out to more people. The nation has a new health policy after 14 years.

The new policy has proposed seven key shifts in organising healthcare services, among them a welcome change in primary care from selective to assured comprehensive care with linkages to referral hospitals.",1

"Brazil is currently implementing the Brasil Sem Miséria programme — a continuation of the successful Fome Zero— which aims to do just that, Marques Porto says. Initiated in 2003 by former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Fome Zero is credited with having taken 30 to 40 million Brazilians out of poverty. One of the core actions of the programme was providing poor children with free school lunches, which were purchased by the state from family farms.

"The data center market in Russia continues to grow. One needs to look only at the considerable increase in commissioned facilities to find evidence of this. Consumers are no longer impressed by data centers spanning several thousand square meters, containing 1000 or more racks—these have become de rigeur. According to data provided by Datacenter Dynamics, for the last two years the Russian data-center market is ahead of India, China and Brazil in terms of total investment. Similarly, based on recent construction data from the same period, Russia places second only to Brazil from BRICS nations in terms of total area.",1

"On Saturday, August 8th, Ukraine’s Interfax News Service announced that the Security Bureau of Ukraine had just issued, on Friday, a list of 14 ‘artists’ (mainly Russian actors) who ‘pose a threat to Ukraine’s national security.’ The Ukrainian State Film Agency is, under Ukrainian law, now prohibited from authorizing or allowing distribution of their films or other works. These artists are thus officially banned. The list also includes French actor Gerard Depardieu, and even Russian economist Mikhail Khazin.

"The main task of North Korea's junior minister for re-information is to refute everything ever said by French intellectuals. One year he did a special on Jean-Paul Sartre and began with Sartre's assertion that ""Three o'clock is always too late or too early for anything you want to do"". As it was a drowsy Friday afternoon, the junior minister simply made a quick call and renamed his local football team 4.25 Sports Club. This made Sartre look very silly indeed, because the club play all their matches at 4.25pm. In fact every time they play, their fans chant ""Are you watching, Jean-Paul Sartre?""",1
