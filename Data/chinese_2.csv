"Voter fraud cases have been confirmed in multiple states, including Mississippi. Louisiana's top election official is warning residents about a potential scam targeting sensitive information from potential voters, after similar concerns arose in several other states. The scam involves a caller claiming to work for a voter registration assistance organization. The caller offers to register residents over the phone and, in some cases, send absentee ballots to voters, according to Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin. Under state law, residents cannot register for voting or request absentee ballots over the phone."
"For small businesses that operate on credit, accounts receivable can make up a large portion of the balance sheet. During the annual audit, the auditor will verify that your claims about accounts receivable balances are substantiated. These claims are called assertions. The most common audit procedure for accounts receivable is confirmation, in which the auditor will ask your customers to confirm their account balances. Understanding which assertions can be confirmed through confirmation can help you understand why your auditor may need to perform multiple audit procedures on the same account. Accounts receivable confirmation is primarily used to substantiate existence assertions."
"It's great not to have to be Jim Furyk today. 1. The U.S. team entered Sunday's play with a commanding four-point lead in the Ryder Cup, and the home crowd was expecting another day of dominant performances. 2. Luke Donald defeated Bubba Watson in the first match of the day to make the score 10-7, but the U.S. still held a commanding lead. Whatever. 3. Europe's Paul Lawrie thoroughly defeated Brandt Snedeker to add another point for Europe. 4. At least Keegan Bradley, the best U.S. player all weekend, was able to go head-to-head with Rory McIlroy."
"This kind of thing happens often: you press the snooze button on your alarm once, twice, or even three times, so when you finally get washed up, dressed, and ready to face the new day, you're already behind schedule. Usually, this results in you completely skipping breakfast. It turns out that your breakfast habits are a time-saving method that should not be ignored. Firstly, eating a nutritious, high-protein, and balanced breakfast every morning has been proven to be an effective way to activate the brain, improve focus, and performance. Additionally, eating breakfast is also associated with better weight control, as it provides energy for the body and may reduce hunger later in the day."
"Dublin: Lawmakers voted overwhelmingly in favor of Ireland's first abortion bill on Friday, which allows for the termination of pregnancy under certain circumstances, when a pregnancy poses a risk to a woman's life, marking a major step forward for the predominantly Catholic country in relaxing its blanket ban on abortion. Exhausted lawmakers applauded the 127-31 vote result on Friday, while abortion rights activists cheered as they watched the result on their phones outside the parliament gates. The vote ended a grueling debate that began on Wednesday morning and continued until 5am on Thursday, with a brief recess, and resumed until midnight on Friday. The lawmakers finally passed the bill, which will allow for abortion under certain circumstances."
"The best Halloween costume inspiration comes from the most unforgettable moments of the year, and 2016 was undoubtedly a memorable one. We witnessed the Summer Olympics and the US Presidential Election, two events that dominate headlines (and Facebook timelines!) every four years. Add to that Beyoncé's visual album masterpiece, the Pokémon Go phenomenon, and the colorful, quotable chaos of Suicide Squad, and 2016 was basically begging for a Halloween costume extravaganza. We've become experts in all things Halloween - creating over 1 billion page views of Halloween content. This is our time to shine."

"VOLGOGRAD, Russia (Reuters) - Iceland will try to defy the sweltering heat of Volgograd when they face Nigeria on Friday in their second World Cup match, after impressively holding two-time champions Argentina to a draw. The World Cup debutants, who are dreaming of advancing to the knockout stage and writing a new chapter in one of the greatest stories in international football in recent years, will attempt to do so. However, standing in their way is not only Nigeria, who desperately need a win after losing 0-2 to Croatia in their opening game, but also the challenge posed by the scorching weather of the southern Russian city of Volgograd."
"A pair of thieves in the Greater Vancouver area have been arrested and charged in connection with a long-standing mail and identity theft. According to a press release issued by the RCMP in Courtenay on November 11, the Courtenay RCMP and Canada Post investigators collaborated on an investigation into the thefts, identifying and arresting the main suspect, and obtaining a large amount of evidence through search warrants.

"We first looked at which big brands had the most expensive maintenance costs over the first 10 years of a car's life. We grouped all models by brand and year to calculate the average cost per brand. To estimate annual maintenance costs, we found the maintenance cost of every other oil change (since oil changes are typically done every six months). It's no surprise that German imports led the list by a wide margin. Toyota, and its two brands Lexus and Scion, were among the cheapest brands, with owners saving at least $10,000 in maintenance costs over 10 years compared to BMW."
"Aurora, Illinois - A suburban boy died after a tragic accident in a high school parking lot.

"Veteran congressman Jim Leach, a Republican from Iowa, lost his seat in the 2006 elections. I'm not defending ""moderate Republicans"" per se, but it's worth mentioning! In my view, Leach was absolutely the best Republican in the House. Nevertheless, one can only be glad about his defeat. In fact, the very occurrence of this event only shows how bad the entire Republican Party has become. Leach was a person with genuinely good instincts and some basically correct ideas about how the US should conduct itself in the world, but he was useless in practice."
"Trump's tweets have long raised questions about whether they violate Twitter's anti-harassment rules. On Monday, after Trump tweeted that North Korea might not ""be around much longer,"" Twitter was forced to explain why it hadn't banned the president from the service. Twitter's public policy account posted a thread of six tweets, in which the company said it considers ""newsworthiness"" and ""public interest"" when determining whether a user has violated its rules. Twitter said these considerations have long been used internally to decide the fate of problematic accounts. The company said its rules are intended to ensure that all users can use the service safely, but it also considers whether certain tweets have news value or serve the public interest. In this case, Twitter deemed Trump's tweet, although controversial, to be of news value and in the public interest, and therefore took no action."
"No one can accurately predict when the stock market will end its record bull run, but the best way for investors to prepare for the next economic downturn is to remain calm and stick to a carefully laid plan. The Star spoke to Ashley Feinstein Gerstley, author of 30-Day Money Cleanse: Take control of your finances, manage your spending, and get rid of financial stress for good, to ask why people struggle so much with money — and how they can do better. People also often overlook or inadvertently misreport other common expenses."

"South Bend, Indiana -- The Irish took to the practice field for the final time on Thursday morning ahead of the Blue Gold Game on Saturday. One of the biggest questions the team faced when spring practice began still doesn't have an answer: who will emerge at the outside linebacker position? Defensive coordinator Clark Lea said fifth-year outside linebacker Asmar Bilal is currently the closest to being ""solid"" in the unit, but he seems content with the uncertainty. He believes the position has made huge strides over the past month and a half, but with a couple of months still to go before Week 1, he's not in a rush to have everything settled. Despite not having made a decision at the position, Lea is pleased with the progress the team has made and is confident they'll find the right guy over the next couple of months."
"This month, Drake wrapped up his residency at London's O2 Arena, but he wasn't ready to head back home just yet. Instead, over the weekend, he joined BBC 1Xtra Rap Show host Tiffany Calver as a co-host for the day. There, he talked about a lot of things. He spoke about the early days of his career and also addressed rumors that he is a culture vulture for borrowing from British and Caribbean culture. But for us Africans, the most interesting thing was his tribute to Niniola."

"It's difficult to exaggerate Amazon's success and its growing influence. Amazon's market value is hovering around $1 trillion. Their growth rate is astonishing. According to most estimates, Amazon currently accounts for nearly 50% of e-commerce sales in the US, about 5% of all retail sales, and is larger than the sum of its next 10 largest competitors. A study found that about 55% of online product searches start on Amazon.

"New York - A lawyer who was filmed berating staff in Spanish at a New York City restaurant issued an apology on Tuesday. ""To the people I insulted, I apologize,"" he said. ""Seeing myself in the video online was a wake-up call - the way I expressed myself was unacceptable and it's not the real me. I see that my words and actions hurt people and I'm truly sorry. While people should be able to express themselves freely, they should do so in a calm and respectful manner. The video didn't show the real me, and I'm not a racist."
"Some apps are meant to change the world, while others are dedicated to bringing beauty to your handheld device. Beautiful Clock Widgets belongs to the latter. This small Android app, as its name suggests, offers a variety of clock widgets, and can add extra data such as local weather and battery information. Some of the widgets are cool, some are funny... and some are just plain weird. It's worth noting that some of the widgets can only be accessed by upgrading to the pro version, which costs $1.26, or the equivalent in local currency."

"[Author: Jonathan Stalin] We often see and hear the two major parties engaging in many unnecessary arguments during debates, a phenomenon that seems to be more pronounced during election campaigns. However, it is rare for the two major parties to proactively seek to discuss real rubbish. I mean, real rubbish!

"The town of South Upi is being plagued by a terror incident involving residents of Bataraza town in Palawan province, which is not attributed to extremists but to politicians. Residents are calling on the government for help to prevent another attack on their island community, which a resident claimed was due to their refusal to support the re-election bid of incumbent Mayor Anton Burahan. Bidding Jubair, a 60-year-old resident of Bataraza, said ""we were helpless"" as he recalled the January 2 attack on the island town, allegedly by Burahan's supporters, who used M203 grenade launchers and M-14 and M-16 rifles. The residents blamed the attack on their refusal to support Burahan's re-election."
"German business confidence plummeted in October to its lowest level in two and a half years, marking the sixth consecutive month of decline, eliminating any doubt that Europe's largest economy is being affected by the euro zone debt crisis. The Munich-based Ifo think tank said on Wednesday that its business climate index, based on a monthly survey of more than 7,000 companies, fell to 100.0 in October from 101.4 in September.

"The life of the mind has always been a puzzle to poets and neuroscientists, who try to map and mark it, while for me it's about searching for it. In Irish tradition, thinking itself is something to think about, so there are many concepts in the Irish language that involve the mind, dreams, and imagination. As a student, many nuances are still unclear to me, but language is about conversation. I would love to hear more mature insights from native speakers about the vocabulary related to thought in Irish."
"According to analysts, the market has entered a consolidation phase after the recent rebound. New Delhi: The below-normal monsoon forecast by private weather agency Skymet had a significant impact on the stock benchmarks on Wednesday, causing the stock benchmarks to give up their gains for the day after hitting new historic highs. According to Skymet, the 2019 monsoon is likely to be ""below normal"", with a long period average (LPA) of 887 mm for the four months (June to September), expected to be only 93%. This led to a sharp correction in the bull market, erasing the previous gains, and the market eventually closed in negative territory."

"Los Angeles - A proposal to grant subpoena power to a oversight commission that oversees the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department was to be put to a vote by voters in March 2020. The proposal failed to gain approval from the board of supervisors today. Supporters of the ""Reform LA Jails"" initiative collected nearly 250,000 signatures in support of the measure, which would also require a civilian oversight commission to study ways to reduce the county's jail population and divert jail construction funds to alternative incarceration methods. Supervisor Sheila Kuehl said the issue should be put to a vote by the county's more than 10 million residents. The board of supervisors failed to approve the proposal, so it will be put to a vote by voters. Supporters of the initiative collected enough signatures to put the issue to a vote."

"On Friday, the Supreme Court directed the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to review a proposal by the Agra Municipal Corporation to set up a waste-to-energy plant at the Kuberpur landfill site.

"Within two weeks, two people were bitten by rattlesnakes. The first incident occurred on April 23 on Mount Tamalpais, where a 79-year-old man was bitten twice by a rattlesnake and had to be airlifted to the hospital. Then, on Friday, a teenage girl was reportedly bitten by a baby rattlesnake in a residential area in the Clayton community, which is near Mount Diablo State Park.

"Grant's Bar and Grill is a vibrant venue where local musicians perform on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights, as well as Sunday afternoons, on the outdoor restaurant patio. If the old fish house could talk, imagine the fascinating stories she would share about her 100 years by the Indian River Lagoon. She could tell us about the early days when entire families would sleep on their fishing boats. We would hear stories about mornings on the river when husbands would take the same boats out to join the fishing fleets, while families stayed behind, with wives working hard to process fish at the fish market."
"Washington D.C., July 31, 2018/3:01 pm - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled on Tuesday that the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority has the right to ban religious-themed advertisements from the Archdiocese of Washington.

"The US is pushing for a plan to relocate Palestinians to the northern part of the Sinai Peninsula and give part of the West Bank to Israel. As President Donald Trump continues to navigate his chaotic presidency with noise and tweets, the Middle East is on the brink of extreme danger.

"Maureen Wilkes believes it's time to understand the true impact of the Vietnam War on the children of veterans. Like many other children of veterans, I was just a statistic. If this study had been done years ago, perhaps it would have been so, perhaps I would have been aware of what was happening to me, not to mention what was happening to my father. Hello, I am the wife of a Vietnam veteran and I have three children. My first daughter was born when I was 18 in my first marriage, then I had two more daughters in my second marriage in 1970."

Cuomo has two Twitter accounts, one with 853,000 followers and another with 10,400 followers. He said that during his re-election campaign last year, reporters told him to follow trends on Twitter."
"Two years ago, I sat in a South Atlantic League baseball game (Low A) watching the Hagerstown Suns host the visiting Greensboro Grasshoppers. Behind me, two Greensboro pitchers, Trevor Richards and Ben Meyer, were charting the game. As I mentioned in this article, neither of the two pitchers seemed to be on the radar for the big leagues. Richards went undrafted out of a small college in 2015, so he had to start his professional career with the Gateway Grizzlies of the independent Frontier League. After a stellar 2016 with Greensboro, he was signed by the Miami Marlins."
"The United Nations, August 26 -- As media predictions of a US missile strike on Syria continue to grow, one can't help but wonder: will the US still launch a strike even if the UN investigation team is still in Syria, regardless of what they find in the suburbs of Damascus? The question is: regarding Syria, British and US officials have stated that the current investigation may be in vain, as Damascus has had time to destroy some evidence. What does the UN hope to achieve through this investigation? What actions is the UN willing to take?"

"Without a doubt, the addiction drama 'Beautiful Boy' - not the horror film 'Halloween' - is the most frightening movie of the weekend. Starring Steve Carell and Timothée Chalamet, the film depicts a young man's descent into methamphetamine addiction (as well as heroin, pills, and marijuana) in a haunting and unsettling manner, as well as the efforts of a devoted father to save him. It's a true and terrifying story that not even mediocre direction and clichéd writing can diminish its impact."

We all lead busy lives, but if you've recently moved into an assisted living house or memory care cottage, it's even more important to stay in touch with loved ones. Nutrition is important for everyone, but it's especially crucial for older adults."

"The United Nations, July 6, update -- As the authorization for the United Nations Mission in Sudan is set to expire on July 8, with South Sudan to declare independence the following day, a Security Council resolution on establishing a new mission in South Sudan had yet to be passed in New York as of July 6. In a meeting of deputy permanent representatives on July 5, one member objected to establishing a new mission before South Sudan's formal declaration of independence, and received support from several other members, citing a paragraph in a draft resolution welcoming the birth of South Sudan."
"Nothing brings people together like ratings and an impending contract negotiation. At a meeting in Midtown Manhattan, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination and the queen of prime-time news put aside their differences. Donald Trump and Megyn Kelly, who had been publicly at odds, or secretly seething, or mutually chilly, met at Trump Tower on Monday, apparently ending their silence. ""Yes, when I walked in, the security guard looked a little shocked,"" Kelly said on her Fox News show on Wednesday night."

"Magic was the best way to describe the Hurricanes championship win, which was hosted by the Lytton High School rugby academy. Over the past two years, since the academy was established, the Lytton under-15 girls' rugby team, under the guidance of Trish Heena, had beaten Wanganui 66-0, Feilding 42-0, and Kapiti 49-0. On the second day, they beat the Wairarapa-Bush combined team 61-0, then Mana College 73-5, before thrashing Feilding 63-10 in the final. The Lytton team was a tight unit, conceding only three tries in six games. Former Black Fern Heena said: ""The girls have worked hard to get to where they are today."""

"Preble County - Over the past week, Preble County has seen two serious traffic accidents involving young people, prompting Preble County Sheriff Mike Simpson to discuss summer driving habits as younger and less experienced drivers become more active during the summer months. According to Simpson, summer roads tend to become busier, with younger drivers appearing more frequently on the roads since they are no longer in school. ""Kids are out of school or college students are home on summer break, so you're going to see more young drivers on the road, going to events or going to work, they're not spending 6-7 hours a day in school,"" Simpson said."
"The family of the deceased bravely listened to the public details of the cause of death. The heartbreaking details of the cause of death of the helicopter crash victims of the Crusaders were read out today in the investigation into the fatal accident. This is a legal mechanism proposed in the joint memorandum of agreement, meaning that the prosecution and the other 14 legal parties in the investigation will not question these details. Gary Arthur, a 48-year-old sales consultant, was found trapped under the rubble of the bar, at which time he had no pulse. Rescuers found him with no signs of life. The autopsy results showed that he died from head injuries."
"The state's Correction Board voted unanimously in a special meeting this morning to appoint interim director Kevin Murphy as the permanent head of the Division of Community Correction.

Murphy comes to the position with a complicated history, drawing pay simultaneously from a nonprofit that serves agency employees and a retirement fund from the correction department."
"As Californians, as people with a voice, we should know what it means to displace people from their land. In the 1950s and 60s, California funded expeditions every year to drive all Native Americans out of the entire area. But this is not just a historical phenomenon: on the West Bank, Israeli settlers and the Israeli government have been trying for decades to eliminate the small Palestinian village of Susya, which has existed near Hebron since at least the 19th century. In the 1980s, it was declared an archaeological site in order to move settlers in and replace the previous inhabitants."

"Every year, civic institutions and state government remind the citizens of Mumbai to be cautious ahead of Diwali. However, like every year, the city has already reported more than 60 firecracker-related injuries. Shockingly, children between the ages of 4 and 14 have suffered eye injuries due to negligence of fire safety measures. Since Tuesday, the city has been in a festive mood, but city hospitals have already recorded 60 firecracker-related injuries. However, since yesterday, local clinics in many residential areas have been getting patients by the hour, adding to the number of injured."
"Bhubaneswar: Finance and Taxation Minister Sashi Bhusan Behera hopes Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) would participate through equity participation in the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) created for the Petroleum, Chemical and Petrochemical Investment Region (PCPIR) and Paradip Plastic Park.

"A cancer expert has discovered a method that can kill tumors using light in just two hours. The technique involves injecting a chemical and then exposing it to ultraviolet light. In laboratory mice, cancer cells were found to self-destruct, with up to 95% of cancer cells dying within two hours. Professor Matthew Gdovin revealed that cancer cells he injected with the compound nitrobenzaldehyde became too acidic to survive. After applying for a patent for the ""photodynamic"" treatment, he said, ""There are many different types of cancer, but they all share the trait of being susceptible to this induced cell suicide."""
"Recently, drones have appeared in a variety of different shapes and sizes, but generally speaking, most drones still belong to one of two major categories. One is the multi-rotor type (quadcopters, hexacopters, octocopters, etc.), and the other is the fixed-wing type. Both types of drones have their advantages and disadvantages. Multi-rotor drones are generally more stable and easier to fly, but much slower than fixed-wing drones that focus on accelerating forward. On the other hand, fixed-wing drones can fly faster and farther than their hovering counterparts, but are more difficult to operate because they cannot take off and land vertically."
"Basel, Switzerland - Roche Holding Ltd., the Swiss pharmaceutical giant, said on Monday it had received reports of 13 cases of H1N1 flu developing resistance to oseltamivir, marketed as Tamiflu, calling it an extremely low proportion. David Reddy, the head of Roche's pandemic task force for oseltamivir, said one piece of good news was that people infected with the resistant strain had not passed the disease to others. The resistant variant also tended to produce only mild symptoms, just like the widely circulating strain. The 13 cases were scattered globally, including in Europe, the United States, and Asia."
"Russian President Vladimir Putin described Turkey's downing of a Russian warplane as a ""stab in the back from the accomplices of terrorism"" and said the incident would have serious consequences. Before meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah on Tuesday, Putin said in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi that the downed plane was attacked in Syrian airspace, just 1 kilometer from the Turkish border, and crashed 4 kilometers inside Syria. This contradicts Turkey's claim that the plane was warned multiple times before being shot down for violating Turkish airspace."
"Arsene Wenger believes that England forward Theo Walcott's return to fitness and the impending return of Germany international Lukas Podolski means that Arsenal do not have to feel extra pressure to buy another striker in January. The Gunners will resume domestic action on Saturday, hoping to bounce back from their defeat to Manchester United by beating third-placed Southampton to maintain their position at the top of the Barclays Premier League. Walcott is set to face his former club after two months out following abdominal surgery. Meanwhile, Podolski, who has been out since August 27 with a hamstring injury, is expected to return at the end of December. The Gunners are hoping that the returns of Walcott and Podolski will help them maintain their position at the top of the league."
"The New York Knicks have completed a quarter of their schedule with a mediocre 9-9 record, with the goal of ending their 43-year championship drought. Coach Jeff Hornacek and the Knicks will have an advantage in December as they face off against opponents. Of the 15 games to be played this month, only five are against teams with a winning percentage of over 50%. They will host the Minnesota Timberwolves, who have a 5-13 record, at home on Friday. Joakim Noah, Derrick Rose, and Carmelo Anthony are undoubtedly the biggest stars on the team, but their performance has not yet met expectations. Anthony's team-leading average of 22.2 points is slightly higher than last season. Hornacek and the Knicks hope to achieve more wins in December, laying the foundation for the team's playoff journey."
"The Hashem Library has always been a beacon of knowledge and a destination for readers and intellectuals until 2000, when the number of readers began to decline due to the difficult economic situation in the Gaza Strip. In the 1950s, the Hashem Library was commissioned to sell newspapers and books from famous Egyptian publishers and distributors. It was also a place where writers and intellectuals gathered. However, the rise of the internet and the poverty of the residents of the Gaza Strip stifled these activities. ""Due to the rise of the internet and economic stagnation, we are no longer able to obtain books for distribution or sale."""
"Google's relationship with China has been tense, with the search giant largely pulling out of the country after accusing state-backed hackers of attacking the company's systems and employees. That's unlikely to improve with the forthcoming book by Chairman Eric Schmidt, ""The New Digital Age,"" which ""repeatedly depicts China as a dangerous and threatening superpower in a connected world,"" Tom Gara wrote, citing a draft reviewed by The Wall Street Journal."
"Ray Trew has resigned as chairman of Notts County Football Club and announced that the English League Two club has been sold. Trew became the owner and chairman of the club in 2010, but he said he made the decision due to his family recently suffering ""vile and mindless abuse"". Notts County are currently 16th in League Two, having been relegated last year, and appointed Jamie Fullarton as their new manager in January. Local businessman Alan Hardy is in talks to buy the club, according to BBC Radio Nottingham.

"To end the war on whistleblowers, the Espionage Act needs to be reformed. Over the past 100 years, the law has evolved into a tool for government secrecy. The evolution of the Espionage Act has had a profound impact on the freedom of political debate in modern America. Originally, the law was a vague decree that gave President Woodrow Wilson the power to imprison critics and censor the media during World War I. Today, it has transformed into a powerful law that regulates political discourse by controlling secrets rather than speech. Censorship did not stop with the end of the war, it has evolved. Despite its name, the Espionage Act has always been a broad decree."
"Google is trying to save presentation audiences from having to endure lengthy and meandering questions through a new feature in its Slides software.

He comes from the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) in Bavaria, Germany. Weber spoke to EURACTIV Germany's Dario Sarmadi. UK Prime Minister David Cameron hopes that if Jean-Claude Juncker becomes President of the European Commission, the UK will leave the EU. What is your response to the UK Prime Minister? The UK belongs to the EU - and is stronger in the European community."
"When Conservative Party leader William Hague walked past a group of loyal listeners on his way to lunch on Tuesday, the presenter's introduction of him as ""the next Prime Minister"" was met with sudden laughter, and even many of his supporters couldn't help but laugh. The London Times, which has always supported the Conservative Party, had just expressed its support for the Labour Party for the first time, supporting the re-election of current Prime Minister Tony Blair. Ladbrokes, the country's largest betting company, had stopped accepting bets on Thursday's general election and had started paying out on Labour winning."

As we approach the mid-2010s, what position does the news industry occupy in the largest advertising market in the United States - digital advertising? And how are all these paywalls performing? Recently, two reports were released within a week, which together help us answer these two questions."
"From the M1917 to the M1A2, American tanks have dominated the battlefield. The US Army and Marine Corps are approaching a centennial milestone - the 100th anniversary of American tank service. This dynamic GIF, created by the staff of partcatalog.com, showcases the evolution of American tanks, from the creaky M1917 light tank to the M1A2 Abrams tank, and demonstrates how the US has gone from being a novice in the world of tanks to a world leader. For example, the M1917 light tank was simply a copy of the Renault FT-17. Such plagiarism in engineering is unimaginable today. Over the past 100 years, the US Army and Marine Corps have made tremendous progress, driving the development of tank technology and making the US the world's leading tank manufacturer."
"Among such groups, the most notable name is Bajrang Dal, whose radicals burned alive an Australian missionary Graham Staines and his two minor sons in Orissa in 1999. This heart-wrenching incident is often quoted as one of the early examples of ""saffron terror"" in India. The ugly face of Hindu terrorism has come into focus again due to the arrest of three persons by the Maharashtra police for their alleged involvement in ""terror activities"" across the state. According to the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), the police recovered 22 items from the accused's residence in Pune. The phenomenon of Hindu terrorism has come into focus again."
"Ron Brown and AAG Archaeology discovered a rare example of a northeast grid door. Below is a drawing of a Tyneside grid door. A toilet door salvaged from a historic building in South Tyneside has become one of the northeast's most unlikely tourist attractions.

It was discovered by the eagle-eyed archaeologist Ron Brown, who is thought to have uncovered one of the best preserved examples of a classic northeast grid door, emerging from the ruins of a demolished toilet."
"M. Night Shyamalan's 2017 horror film Split, the most exciting part was at the end, which is also one of the few things the movie did right. The character David Dunn, played by Bruce Willis in Unbreakable, appeared in a brief and surprising scene at the end, creating a shared universe that Shyamalan was eager to capitalize on. However, there is a huge gap between giving fans a fleeting cameo and building a story around it. As the third installment of the trilogy, Glass looks like a mess of half-baked ideas thrown together, forming an unbalanced chaos."

"Sign the RootsAction petition to tell mayors and police chiefs across the country that you support the right to peaceful protest without hindrance. The Occupy Wall Street protesters won a major victory on Friday when New York City Mayor Bloomberg and Brookfield Properties, the owners of Manhattan's Lower Manhattan Zuccotti Park, backed down from their demands that protesters temporarily leave the park for cleaning and comply with new rules that would have banned sleeping bags, many types of equipment, and even lying down in the park. However, protesters in many other cities have not been so fortunate."

"Technology executives discussed the impact of automation technology on their organizations. For many organizations and employees, technological automation is both an opportunity and a threat. On the one hand, the use of robotic process automation and other tools can improve efficiency by automating manual and repetitive tasks. On the other hand, it has the potential to make jobs redundant. Recently, technology executives gathered at roundtable meetings in Sydney and Melbourne to discuss the impact of automation technology on their organizations. One of the key issues was how to ensure compliance with management policies and procedures as ""robots"" replace people in tasks performed throughout the business. Other issues discussed included how to manage the changes brought about by automation technology and how to ensure that employees are able to adapt to new technologies and ways of working. The technology executives believed that automation technology will continue to have a significant impact on organizations over the next few years, and therefore they need to take proactive measures to address these changes."

"Edgar Wright has never made a bad film, he has never even made a mediocre one. It makes sense, then, that Wright has thus far avoided making direct sequels throughout his career. However, this may be about to change with the arrival of Baby Driver. When Shaun of the Dead was a huge success, Wright, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost didn't capitalize on the film's success by making a zombie sequel, instead opting to collaborate with Pegg and Frost on a thematically-linked trilogy - the ""Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy"" - which also includes the equally excellent Hot Fuzz and The World's End."
"The Pakistani Taliban movement (TTP) appears to be unable to fund its operations due to a lack of funding.

"The US Government Accountability Office reported that the Small Business Administration needs to improve its planning for its new database system. The Small Business Administration had planned to launch the Electronic Loan Information Processing System (ELIPS), which is used to track government-backed small business loans online, but the Government Accountability Office believes that the agency has not proven that the project is a good investment. The Small Business Administration stated that it did not have time to complete the analysis required by the Clinger-Cohen Act because Congress required the system to be online by June 30. The US Army Materiel Command has issued guidelines to improve teamwork between agencies and contractors."

In 1980, a group of non-commissioned officers, despite strong resistance from a better-equipped police force, overthrew the democratically elected government, with the police force surrendering only after naval gunfire.

"I first heard these verses in a small chapel in Kiev, Ukraine. I remember the day, because it was a Sunday morning, the day the tragic news of Princess Diana's death was being reported. I had just left my job on Wall Street and was living with my mother in Kiev, because my father had passed away, and I was there because I was feeling lost and without direction. I recall sitting in the back of the room, surrounded by wooden walls, feeling a bit self-consciously amongst my fellow foreigners' passionate evangelism. But when I heard these verses, my mind was drawn back in."

"Guess what, the NBA is actually an entertainment show. It's just that super producer David Stern isn't pulling all the strings from behind the scenes (or else New York would somehow magically win the lottery). Instead, the league stumbles along like an over-budget, out-of-control Hollywood blockbuster - driven by the egos of its marquee players, full of jaw-dropping plot twists, and suffering from endless rewrites. And it gets worse: we haven't even mentioned the Los Angeles Lakers yet. Unfortunately, the biggest news so far this season has nothing to do with basketball."

"The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) plans to put a small robot into a volcano in Hawaii to collect data and geographic features such as fissures and volcanic vents to map the inside of the volcano. Currently, a similar robot is already exploring the volcano. Dr. Carolyn Parcheta, a postdoctoral researcher at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said: ""We don't entirely understand how volcanoes erupt, we have some models, but they're all very, very simplified. The goal of this project is to help make those models more realistic."" According to NASA, the robot developed by NASA can climb into areas that humans cannot enter."
"Hearst Magazines will be busy in 2018, completing its acquisition of Rodale, buying some magazines in the Netherlands, and increasing the frequency of its two newest titles. The Pioneer Woman magazine, a joint venture with blogger and Food Network star Ree Drummond, published two best-selling issues in 2017 and will increase its frequency to four issues in 2018. In his annual year-end memo to staff, Hearst Magazines president David Carey noted that it's a good time to be in the magazine business, citing Airbnb's failed attempt to launch its own magazine, Pineapple, in 2014, which only published one issue."
"Activists insist that future meetings in the heart of Dundee should include discussions about accessibility for the disabled. What was supposed to be a pleasant Turkish delight turned into a bittersweet experience of St Johnstone's as their UEFA Cup draw caused chaos. A nursery in Dundee failed to increase its childcare places. Dundee inventor John Cruckshank died at the age of 84. Originally as an act of defiance, it soon spread globally. Angus Council ordered a retired person from Montrose to remove all bird feeders from their front garden."
"The daughter of Kannada tabloid editor claimed today that her father is ""innocent"" and will come out ""safe"" from the case. Her father was arrested for allegedly hiring a contract killer to murder his colleague journalist. Ravi Belagere, the publisher of 'Hi Bangalore', was arrested from his house yesterday for allegedly hiring a 'supari' killer, a hitman from the Indian underworld, from Vijayapura in northern Karnataka to kill Sunil Heggaravalli. ""In this case, no one has filed the first information report based on someone's complaint, it's a case that the police have taken up on their own based on the contract killer's statement."
"Manatees are large, grey, aquatic mammals. They have full-bodied figures - I'm sure clothing companies would try to say manatees are ""voluptuous"" to convince them to buy plus-sized jeans - that taper off into a flat, paddle-like tail. Adult manatees typically range from about 10 feet long and weigh from 800 to 1,200 pounds. Manatees are one of the ugliest sea creatures created by God, and the sea has a lot of weird creatures. These are facts I learned from the ""Save the Manatee Club"" website - interestingly, the observation of ugliness is subjective, but it's obvious enough to be considered a fact."
"Arcade games are no longer just for kids! Some top online casinos now offer arcade games that can be played with real money. But the latest and most exciting way to play real money arcade games is by using an Apple iPhone. Playing iPhone arcade games is fun and easy. Players simply need to sign up at an online iPhone casino and then can find links to play a variety of iPhone casino games, including some arcade-style games. The arcade casino game type is extremely suitable for the iPhone. Players can play their favorite games anywhere and anytime, and they can also place real money bets. Apple's mobile devices allow players to play games anywhere, so iPhone arcade games are a very convenient and fun form of entertainment."
"French woman Isabelle Dinoire, who underwent the world's first face transplant, showed off her new look to the public on Monday. Speaking in a slurred tone, she said she now looks ""like anyone else"" and hopes to resume a normal life. Isabelle's pronunciation was difficult to understand, but she explained how she was attacked by a dog last year and thanked the donor's family for giving her new lips, chin, and nose. In the 15-hour operation on November 27 in Amiens, doctors transplanted facial tissue onto her face, which still bears a thin, circular scar."
"Did Donald Trump release Donald Trump's tax returns? For a moment, it seemed like Rachel Maddow had a genuine scoop. Then, suddenly, it turned out to be a fact... thanks to MSNBC, the claim that Trump ""paid no taxes for 18 years"" was proven false. Additionally, Trump's 2005 tax rate seemed higher than that of most politicians, and his income was quite substantial. However, we cannot be certain whether the report was selectively extracted."
"Pleasant Mount, Lackawanna County - School officials are requiring students who haven't received the latest vaccine to stay home for several weeks as St. Peter's County deals with a mumps outbreak. According to Dr. Sam Ray, superintendent of the North St. Peter School District, there are two confirmed cases of mumps in St. Peter's County, one of which is a student in the school district, he said. Another potential case of mumps is awaiting test results from health officials, Ray said. Ray didn't specify which school the student with mumps attends, but said North St. Peter High School is ""involved"" in the outbreak."
"During times of hardship, creative bakers turned to desperation pies: vinegar pies and green tomato pies, which are not typically on America's list of favorite desserts. However, these and other desperation pies have endured to this day, showcasing the resourcefulness of home cooks during the Great Depression in America. Some desperation pies, like green tomato pie, still have a devoted following today. Imagine yourself as a thrifty farmer during the Great Depression, wanting to make a dessert for your family, but traditional pie ingredients, such as cherries or pecans, are too expensive or unattainable."
"There's a Speed Graphic camera here, which used to be standard equipment in newsrooms across the country. You may have seen them in movies from the 1930s and 1940s, hordes of photographers with press passes pinned to the hatbands of their fedoras! The Speed Graphic was a massive, heavy camera that required flashbulbs the size of light bulbs to take pictures at night, and it was the first professional camera I used, for my high school yearbook and the newspaper I worked for part-time during high school and college. I have a Speed Graphic in my office that uses sheet film - you take one picture, then pull out the slide, and load another."
"Anyone who has ever been frustrated with taking video in low-light conditions will be excited about Canon's strange and amazing new camera. It's a camera that can shoot full HD color video in almost complete darkness. This ""multipurpose"" camera, called the MH20F-SH, has a 2.26 megapixel full-frame sensor. The reason for the lower resolution is that each pixel is enormous - precisely 19 micrometers, which is 7.5 times larger than the pixels on Canon's flagship DSLR, the 1Dx."
"Is our efficient tax authority stifling the country? I have never seen a report from the central bank urging the government to cut taxes. But it is indeed the case now, and this partly explains why the economy is going downhill. In fact, as can be seen from this rare piece of historical data, tax commissioner Chris Jordan and his team have done a great job in cracking down on over-claiming, particularly from businesses. With the productivity brought by computer technology, the government's tax revenue is soaring."
"Facility managers wear many hats, and it's not uncommon for a facility manager to lead meetings, provide plumbing advice, propose renovation ideas, and ensure the floors are properly cleaned all in one day. When considering facility operations, the facility manager takes into account the safety and well-being of all building occupants. To be a successful facility manager, one needs to have a solid management background, technical skills, a foundation in construction, and knowledge of technical aspects. The facility manager is responsible for overseeing the physical facilities of a building or group of buildings."
"A professor of communications at Texas A&M University wanted to understand the impact of changes in the newspaper industry on politics in our country, so she did some research and published it in the Journal of Communications. If you've noticed that political polarization seems to have increased dramatically over the past few years, you're not imagining things. As Johanna Dunaway of Colorado State University and Louisiana State University and her colleagues found, this polarization occurred during a period when the number of local newspapers and journalists has been steadily decreasing nationwide."
"Washington -- At the center of a nationwide Salmonella outbreak, an Iowa egg producer apologized on Wednesday before a congressional subcommittee and acknowledged that his family-run business had ""gotten too big"" before it stopped operating like a small business. Egg producer Austin J. DeCoster said in testimony before the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee, ""What I mean is, we got too big before we started adopting some of the necessary complex procedures to ensure we were meeting all of the government requirements."" He is the founder of an egg empire that has been linked to multiple deadly Salmonella outbreaks in several states over the past three decades. DeCoster's company is believed to be at the center of the recent Salmonella outbreak."
"A Conservative candidate has been disqualified for failing to disclose a pending drink-driving case, for which he was later convicted. Ben Wong, 48, who owns the New Dragon Palace takeaway on Silver Street, was standing for the Conservatives in the Victoria ward by-election on May 2, but was disqualified after being convicted. The deadline for nominations had already passed on April 3, but he appeared at Yeovil Magistrates' Court on March 21 without informing the local Somerset Conservatives."
"Battfleck is officially no more! Ben Affleck has officially stepped down as Bruce Wayne in The Batman and is passing the torch to a new actor who has yet to be chosen. Warner Bros. had previously announced the official release date for The Batman, the standalone DC adventure film, which is set to hit theaters on June 25, 2021. Shortly after the news broke, Ben Affleck took to social media to congratulate director Matt Reeves, who will be leading the Caped Crusader into the future. It was later confirmed that the tweet was Ben Affleck's way of bidding farewell to the role."
"When dining out, it's customary to leave a tip, but a tip added to an order of a milkshake and fries at a New Jersey restaurant has left parents outraged. Melissa Desh said, ""My daughter came to tell me that every time she and her friends go to the restaurant, they are charged a tip."" ""When I asked her why, she said, 'because they're kids,'"" Desh said. Her daughter, Isabella, and other students from Colfax Middle School frequently visit the Wayne Hills Diner, located across from Hamburg Turnpike."
"Dallas - Like many Americans, Martin Jacobson was thrilled by the Navy SEALs' killing of Osama bin Laden. But the Dallas resident has a deeper connection to the men who hunted down the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. Decades ago, he was one of them. During World War II, Jacobson was a member of an elite unit that was the precursor to the SEALs. The secretive unit was accustomed to keeping a low profile, but it has found itself in the headlines again after the bin Laden raid. ""I'm just proud of the SEALs,"" said Jacobson, 89."
"Northern Ireland is today dubbed the race hate capital of Europe, a report on racist violence in the province has concluded. Human rights campaigner Doreen Lawrence, mother of murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence, was in Belfast for the launch of the report by the Northern Ireland Council for Ethnic Minorities (NICEM). The report highlights institutionalized racism within the justice system and questions how it can be tackled. Racist violence in Northern Ireland has been on the increase in recent years, with not just black and Asian people, but virtually anyone perceived as being different, being targeted in attacks."
"About 300 villagers from Kandal province's Gold Mountain village submitted a petition to the embassy in Phnom Penh yesterday and then protested in front of the provincial government building, calling on Prime Minister Hun Sen for help. The villagers told The Post that they want to put an end to the land dispute caused by the company's ""land grab"" and said they would rather die than return home without a solution. They said government departments had ignored their pleas for help, while the company had used the judicial system to arrest villagers who complained about land clearance."
"The incline bench press is a strength training exercise that targets the upper chest and anterior shoulders. The exercise is performed on an incline bench by lying on the bench and gripping dumbbells or a barbell with an over-the-shoulder grip, then lifting the weight upwards over the chest by extending and flexing the elbow. Alternatively, an incline chest press machine can be used to replicate the movement, with the machine moving on a fixed plane. The incline bench press is one of several exercises that can help create a symmetrical and strong upper body."
"Klopp revealed his delight at ending Guardiola's Manchester City's 22-game unbeaten run, exclaiming ""What was that?!"" during the live broadcast, while the Liverpool head coach also hit back at critics who said his defense was vulnerable, adding ""Blow my shoes off!"" Klopp was ecstatic after Liverpool's 4-3 win over title favorites Manchester City. In a thrilling match at Anfield, Liverpool led 4-1 in the second half, before Manchester City scored two goals in the final stages, making the ending tense."
"No one asked me, but... if you pay dues to a neo-Nazi organization, subscribe to racist publications, buy tickets to Holocaust denial conferences, and have Holocaust denial DVDs in your video collection, you might be a neo-Nazi. You don't become a neo-Nazi overnight. You can change your mind and your thinking, and come clean. If you want people to believe you're no longer a neo-Nazi, you're going to have to do a lot of persuading. It takes a lot of effort to shed the brown shirt."
"Brent Moloney's first step in making amends for his post-season binge drinking was his quiet reinstatement into the club's leadership group midway through the season. The second step was more public and more significant, as he won the Melbourne best and fairest award last night. The 27-year-old Moloney received the Keith 'Bluey' Truscott Trophy at the Crown Palladium, edging out key defenders Jared Rivers and James Frawley. Moloney's two midfield teammates, Nathan Jones and Jack Trengove, finished fourth and fifth respectively."
"The Weeknd will collaborate with Daft Punk at the Grammys. LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Weeknd will collaborate with Daft Punk at the Grammys. The singer's pairing with the electronic music duo was one of several announced Tuesday. Anderson .Paak will perform with A Tribe Called Quest and Dave Grohl. Maren Morris will perform with Alicia Keys. The Grammys had previously announced that Adele, John Legend, Bruno Mars, Metallica, Carrie Underwood and Keith Urban would also perform."
"Dartmouth - On Flag Day, June 14, students from the James M. Quinn Elementary School in Dartmouth gathered outside to celebrate Flag Day. In itself, this was not an unusual event, but this year's ceremony had a deeper meaning for them. The reason was that Dr. Carol Calafati's cousin, Ted Cote from New Bedford, was serving in Iraq. Earlier this year, around Veterans Day, Dr. Calafati asked her students to send cards to Sergeant Ted Cote in Iraq to boost his morale. The students responded by making cards and sending them to Iraq."
"Will UBS appoint Bob McCann or Sallie Krawcheck to a top wealth management position? According to two industry headhunters quoted by Investment News, Bob McCann, the former head of brokerage at Merrill Lynch, and Sallie Krawcheck, the former head of wealth management at Citigroup, are both potential candidates for the top position in UBS's wealth management division. Earlier, the Financial Times reported that Oswald Gruebel, the new CEO of UBS, had decided not to sell the company's wealth management business in the US, despite rumors in recent months that he might sell the business in response to tax evasion allegations and subsequent scandal."
"If the outcome of the US presidential election were to be decided by social media, Barack Obama would clearly defeat Republican challenger Mitt Romney next year. The Obama campaign has already embraced social media, with the president having a large following on Facebook and Twitter, and the Democratic National Committee using a private social networking tool to communicate with some campaign staff. There is also evidence that the Obama campaign is using social media analytics tools to gauge voter sentiment and track the popularity of campaign messages. Despite contacting both campaigns to discuss their social media strategies, neither responded."
"Should we stop defining what impact investing is. Now that they're gone, we can get down to business. I've spent the last four years covering impact investing as a contributor to Forbes, and I've written hundreds of articles on the subject. The thing is, most impact investing is only available to the wealthy. This is a guide to impact investing for everyone else, which is to say the 98% of the population that doesn't qualify to invest alongside the rich."
"The health department has issued another measles warning as a person infected with the disease used public transportation and visited two universities and a supermarket. This is the fourth warning in recent weeks. The recently infected person visited multiple public venues between Sunday, January 27, and Wednesday, January 30. On January 30, they took the train from Aubin Grove to Perth between 10:25 am and 11:15 am, and from Canning Bridge to Mandurah between 2:20 pm and 3:15 pm. They also took bus 100 from Canning Bridge to Cannington between 10:50 am and 11:40 am, and bus 101 from Curtin University to Canning Bridge between 2:00 pm and 2:50 pm."

"Today is expected to be sunny as a high-pressure system sets up over the weekend. After a chilly start, temperatures will rise into the 40s and 50s. It's expected to be cooler tonight under mostly clear skies, with lows in the 20s and 30s. Tomorrow, winds will come from the south, which means we'll see some milder temperatures, with highs expected to reach the 50s, and possibly even the 60s in some areas. However, as the day progresses, more clouds are expected to form. It appears that the clouds will thin out at night, with lows in the 30s and 40s."
"It looks like the scene after an earthquake, with orange cardboard boxes scattered all over the floor, shoes stuffed into every gap, and people standing there in a daze, in a state of shock. But this is not a natural disaster, it's Black Friday at a Nike factory store in Seattle. The Seattle Premium Outlets in Tulalip, Washington, shared photos and videos after the holiday, showing the horrific scene of shoppers trampling the orange cardboard boxes that were originally used to protect Nike shoes, and carelessly picking up and discarding athletic shoes as they wandered around the store."
"The 27th annual Southern Iowa Hot Air Balloon Festival is being held in Creston this weekend. Bill Fastenow, a spokesperson for the Balloon Committee, said that wind is a key factor in determining whether the hot air balloons will fly and in which direction they will go. Fastenow said that there will be a pilots' meeting at 4:30 this afternoon, followed by a ""Night Glow"" at the Creston Airport on the south side of town, which he described as a beautiful sight. Ellen Gerhart, the Executive Director of the Creston Chamber of Commerce, said that at least 57 hot air balloon pilots have signed up to participate in the event this weekend."

"The unemployment rate in Stark County fell to 6.8% in August, the lowest since September 2008. Stark County's unemployment rate was below 7% for the first time since 2008, and there are several reasons for the decline. The most likely reason is the oil and gas drilling in the Utica Shale, which has brought a surge of businesses to the area. Oil exploration companies arrived first, followed by engineering and construction companies that provide a variety of services. Manufacturing has also experienced growth due to increased demand for steel and drilling equipment from both local and national sources."
"A horror movie icon will be visiting a haunted attraction in Gaston County on Wednesday and Thursday. Actor Derek Mears, known for his roles in Friday the 13th (2009), Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, Predators, and Men in Black II, will be meeting with horror movie fans at The Haunted Mill in Belmont. Kevin Blanchfield, owner of the mill, said he tries to bring something new and exciting to the attraction every year. He expects the appearance of Friday the 13th's Jason Voorhees to boost weekday attendance, which typically sees 200 to 300 people on non-Halloween nights."
"Washington (United News Agency) - Gold prices remained stable on Thursday after the Federal Reserve released its latest economic report, which stated that businesses across the United States had become less optimistic over the past few months. Spot gold prices rose 0.2% to $1,294.11 per ounce, while US gold futures were basically flat at $1,293.75 per ounce. As the challenges facing the economy intensify, it is expected that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates stable at least until June. The dollar temporarily stopped rising after its recent gains, while the pound stabilized after British Prime Minister Theresa May won a vote of confidence in parliament and urged lawmakers to break the Brexit deal deadlock."
"President Zuma believes that the Public Protector's report on state capture is a political tool used to target certain individuals. In an exclusive interview with ANN7 on Monday night, President Zuma shared his views on the report by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela on state capture. The report recommended that President Zuma appoint a judicial commission of inquiry, led by a judge chosen by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng, to investigate the state capture allegations. The report investigated whether President Zuma's friends, the controversial Gupta family, had undue influence over the government."
"We like it because: few things are more fashionable than a good night's sleep. After all, a well-rested night can make you look radiant in the morning - and also feel refreshed. One of the most important factors affecting sleep quality is a good mattress. The new mattress comes in a variety of sizes, from single to California king size, and mattresses of different sizes are made of five layers of ""high-end"" foam, including one inch of ""flo"" foam, one and a half inches of latex foam, one and a half inches of memory sponge foam, and one and a half inches of high-elastic foam, containing supportive gel columns."
"Jenna Barker from Seton Catholic came in first place in the 1600 meter race with a time of 5:13.04, setting a new regional record, and also won the 800 meter race. At the IHSAA girls track regional held at Connersville High School on Tuesday, several area athletes qualified for the regional. Other individual regional champions included Richmond's Riley Austin, who won the 200 meter and long jump; Richmond's Nakala Bennett, who won the 100 meter; Seton Catholic's Hannah Stamm, who won the 3200 meter; and Richmond's Austin, Lindsay Griffin, Peyton VanMiddlesworth, and Riley Wetzel, who won the 400 meter relay."
"When the theme of the convention seems to be ""Drill, baby, drill"", an energy policy that's like ""Tax, baby, tax"" is a fiscal policy (i.e., it isn't), it's clear that the slogan is all the party has left. Even if you think it makes sense to increase offshore drilling to improve oil exploration and supply, you can't take these people seriously. Unfortunately, yes, you can. By the way, this was the moment when I completely lost interest in the convention."
"The newly appointed chairman of the National Children's Hospital board has stated that allowing the hospital's main builder to exit its role would be ""bad business"". The incoming chairman, Fred Barry, who attended this morning's Oireachtas health committee meeting, also said that the project was underestimated from the start, which led to a massive cost increase from an estimated €800 million in 2014 to the current €1.73 billion."
"Bob Cannard was turning compost with a shovel at Green String Farm outside Petaluma, California, compost that had originated as food scraps from San Francisco, on Friday, March 6, 2009. As a parent and one who has worked with parents for years, I was shocked by the heartbreaking front-page story in the El Cerrito edition about the death of an infant (“Baby Dies in Car: Tragic Lesson for All Parents,” June 10, 2009). The notion that parents can “easily forget their children in the back seat” is, unfortunately, heartbreakingly true."
"Southeast Toyota Distributors, LLC (SET) is recalling certain model year 2016 Toyota Yaris, RAV4, Land Cruiser and 4Runner vehicles, as well as Scion FR-S, iM, and TC vehicles, manufactured from January 28, 2016, to March 14, 2016. The Load Carrying Capacity Modification Label may not reflect the correct added weight of the installed accessories, causing the vehicle to be overloaded, resulting in a vehicle that does not comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard number 110, ""Tire Selection and Rims."" Consequence: An incorrect label may lead to the vehicle being overloaded, increasing the risk of a crash."
"A lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union today asked a federal appeals court in San Francisco to block a California law that requires police to collect DNA samples from anyone arrested for a felony. The law, which was part of a 2004 voter initiative, expanded DNA collection in the criminal justice system by using cheek swabs. Four plaintiffs are challenging a provision that took effect in 2009, which requires DNA sampling of anyone arrested for a suspected felony, regardless of whether they are charged or convicted of a crime."
"Is that really so? Is the matter really that complicated? The Green Bay Press-Gazette reported that police said they would need only two to three weeks to complete the investigation into the alleged sexual assault involving Packers cornerback Brandon Underwood. Underwood was accused by two Milwaukee women of sexually assaulting them after a charity event at a resort in Lake Delton, Wisconsin. The incident occurred on June 5, and a few days after the incident, police officials said they suspected that the incident would not lead to any charges. One big issue is that the women's stories changed, initially involving multiple Packers players, and later only involving Underwood."
"A new logo is to be developed to help identify Seminole County community's perception of the Seminole County School District, and the logo will use at least one of the top four winning entries from the county logo contest. School board members said they wanted a new logo because the current one - a school crossing sign - did not reflect the district's academic achievements. The contest was divided into four age groups: elementary for 10 and under, junior for 11-14, senior for 15-18, and adult for 19 and older."
"Los Angeles (AP) - Kings forward Anze Kopitar will undergo surgery on Wednesday to repair the torn ligaments he suffered in a severe sprain of his right ankle. An MRI performed on Monday confirmed that the Kings' top scorer will require corrective surgery, which will sideline him indefinitely. Kopitar was injured in a fall during the Kings' game against Colorado on Saturday. Coach Terry Murray initially said the Slovenian All-Star had broken his ankle and would be out at least six weeks, but the Kings ultimately determined it was only a high ankle sprain. Kopitar leads the Kings with 25 goals and 43 assists."
"A crash on State Highway 2 near WaikamaruMaru has left two people injured. Initial reports suggested a three-vehicle collision occurred yesterday, but police now believe two separate accidents happened at the same spot, near Apata Station Road. A St John Ambulance spokesperson said two people were taken to Tauranga Hospital, one in a serious condition and the other in a moderate condition. Police were initially called to the incident at 1:10pm. ""There were two accidents in the same area in a short space of time. It appears a small van drove off the road and then a car and a truck collided."""

He worked as a railroad engineer for the Southern Pacific Railroad Company for 34 years. Richard was a member of the Dunsmuir Veterans of Foreign Wars. His interests included bowling, cars, music, travel, and his love for his family."
"Data released by the Korean Shipbuilders' Association has confirmed the expectations of many analysts: the number of active shipyards around the world has decreased by more than 40% compared to seven years ago. The study defines an active shipyard as one that has at least one ship on order. According to the association's data, the number of active shipyards in China decreased from 380 to 140, and the number of shipyards in Japan decreased from 70 to 60 during the same period. What's worse, the world's largest shipyards - Daewoo Shipbuilding, Hyundai Heavy Industries, and Samsung Heavy Industries - may have idle space and unused capacity sometime next year."
"""Interaction of Color"", a groundbreaking book published by Josef Albers in 1963, a German-born artist and educator who taught at the Bauhaus, Black Mountain College, and Yale University, is not just for aspiring artists. The book's fascinating illustrations are a revelation for anyone interested in color theory and human perception. On Thursday, in celebration of the book's 50th anniversary, the original publisher, Yale University Press, will offer a new way to learn from Albers' teachings by releasing an ""Interaction of Color"" iPad app."
"Defending champion Victoria Azarenka struggled to a 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 win over injured American Jamie Hampton on Saturday to advance to the fourth round of the Australian Open. Hampton required a medical timeout for lower back problems, often grimacing in pain and on the verge of tears after holding serve in the second set and throughout the third, but still managed to hit 41 winners to put pressure on the top-ranked Azarenka. Azarenka sometimes looked frustrated, but overcame her early mistakes and saved three break points in the seventh game of the deciding set to win the match in 2 hours and 9 minutes."
"Suzuki Motor Corporation discovered that out of 12,819 vehicles, 6,401 had undergone improper testing since 2012. In a major blow to Japanese automakers, Suzuki Motor Corporation announced that the company had used improper fuel economy and emissions testing in Japan. According to Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism, Suzuki, along with Mazda and Toyota, admitted to cheating in emissions tests and submitting selective sample manufacturing vehicles in the quality assurance process. Additionally, the samples were tested under inaccurate driving conditions. However, the company is not currently considering recalling these products."
"Brands should resist the temptation to tackle sensitive topics in the Super Bowl in order to draw attention, said Aimee Drolet, a professor of marketing and behavioral decision-making at the University of California, Los Angeles' Anderson School of Management: ""Generally, it's not the best place to do these things, because the audience is so broad, you're always going to offend half the people,"" she said. In other news, University of California officials announced that the system's 10 campuses set a new fundraising record in 2017-18, raising more than $2.7 billion."
"Margaret O'Brien, 69, moved to Wolverhampton from Canada in 1971, married and had three children, and worked for the local council for over 25 years, doing jobs such as a waitress, dinner lady, lollipop lady and cleaner. A few years ago, she had to leave work due to a back injury, which led to her first claim for benefits. In 2015, she was told her disability benefits were being suspended because she was an illegal immigrant. A letter informed her: ""If you do not leave voluntarily, we will remove you to your country of origin."""
"Let's just not label them anymore, as long as they're happy, okay. Alright, I'll just say it, everyone's been speculating whether Taylor Swift and Calvin Harris are a couple: they're just dating. You must have heard Taylor's 2014 song ""I Know Places"". The song is about developing a romantic relationship while being chased by paparazzi. ""When everybody else is watching, too / Watching those dark clouds gather / Love is a fragile little flame, it could burn out"", she sings. Just go for it, Haylor."
"PARIS (Reuters) - Longchamp, France's leading handbag maker, plans to increase its presence in China, in stark contrast to competitors that are scaling back their business in the country due to an economic slowdown and a shift in consumer culture. Many luxury brands, such as Kering's Gucci and LVMH's Louis Vuitton, have stopped opening new stores in China to maintain their exclusive image. ""We are still far from having fully developed the Chinese market,"" said Jean Cassegrain, CEO of the privately-held Longchamp group, in an interview with Reuters."
"The annual gathering of the Kellys is usually a joyful affair. The get-together, conceived by New York Post media columnist Keith J. Kelly, has been held for the past three years at Langan's on 47th Street, coinciding with St. Patrick's Day.

"Searching for ""toxic mold"" yields hundreds of frightening warnings and ""studies"", but little based on science - and much of it motivated by financial gain. Recently, one of my patients was hospitalized for alcoholic liver failure. He had a long history of liver disease, but insisted that no one had ever told him to avoid alcohol. Initially, he admitted to only having ""a few drinks"", but as other medical personnel questioned him further, his story changed to more. Despite his liver being in severe shock, he remained stable, and fortunately, most of his liver function was still intact."

Mobile devices are now the preferred way to interact with the online world, whether it's the destination or the content. Video is no longer an option, use it to create real demos, or you will be left behind. I have a confession to make: I don't attend Inman Connect to network.

"Dundee has long been a city of contrasts, with great wealth and extreme poverty. If the new V&A museum can bring about a turnaround, it will be worth every penny. I declare my interest.

"Two groups concerned about mental health care want to know which Vermont doctors received thousands of dollars in gifts from pharmaceutical companies last year. Due to a law protecting trade secrets, pharmaceutical companies can keep some names confidential. The two groups believe this loophole should be closed. Last year, Vermont doctors and other healthcare providers received approximately $3.1 million in gifts from pharmaceutical companies. Vermont is one of the few states that require pharmaceutical companies to disclose such marketing expenses. These payments include consulting fees, travel, gifts, and speaking fees. The two groups believe that pharmaceutical companies bribing doctors may influence their prescribing behavior, affecting patients' health. Therefore, they are calling for the closure of this loophole to make the names of all doctors who receive gifts from pharmaceutical companies publicly transparent."

"Everyone remembers where they were and what they were doing when the nightmare of 911 occurred. Chuck was getting ready to go to work, and I was watching Fox News on the computer when terrifying images appeared on the screen. I had the TV muted, so I only saw flames coming out of a large building in New York. I turned on the sound, and the words of the announcer sounded completely incomprehensible. It was strange that tears welled up in my eyes before I even knew what had happened and why. Interestingly, your intuition takes control of your thoughts before your brain reacts."

Al-Shabab began tweeting in English on Wednesday under the username @HSMPress. (HSM is an abbreviation of the more grandiose name Harakat al-Shabab al-Mujahideen.) The account, which has not been verified by Jack Dorsey and his team, sounds legitimate enough: one tweet on Wednesday said that terrorists ""welcomed"" the surrender of seven Somali government soldiers after they ""apostated"" and repented."

Orwell described Newspeak as ""the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year"". Orwell's idea of creating Newspeak was to build a world where all nuances in language are eliminated, thus strengthening the state's total control. Calling something its complete opposite can also be an example of Orwellian Newspeak, such as calling a bill full of social program spending an economic stimulus plan."

"The input appears to contain a mix of Chinese characters, English words, and punctuation marks, but due to the chaotic nature of the text, its overall meaning is unclear.

If we attempt to extract and translate the recognizable Chinese parts, we may find something like this:

- "","" translates to ""and""
- "","" in this case translates to ""and"" or ""comma"", but its usage is ambiguous without a clear sentence
- ""!"" translates to an exclamation mark

Given the lack of coherent sentences or phrases in the input, it is impossible to provide a meaningful translation that conveys specific information or ideas. The text appears to be a mixture of characters and symbols without a clear structure or context. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a clear translation."

"Washington - RFK Stadium, once and future home of the capital's Major League Baseball team, is not now an ideal venue. It is currently configured for soccer, not baseball. The field needs to be changed, the seats, locker rooms, and press box need to be upgraded. Last week, on a rainy day, a quarter of the field was mud and tire tracks. It looked like Vince Lombardi should have been coaching football here - and he did, for the Washington Redskins, in 1969. But that was 1969."
"The millennial generation is not a homogenous group, so a unified marketing strategy does not work. Millennials want healthy food and are willing to pay more for it. No, wait - millennials are saddled with debt but still want affordable healthy food. They are also entitled. But they are creative and tech-savvy, which is a good thing. And whatever you do, don't try to reach them through traditional advertising, do it through social media instead. If all of this sounds familiar, it's because it's just a small part of the many contradictory reports about millennials."
"A series of powerful short films in which children explain in their own words how they live with various illnesses and allergies. The films are relevant to the PSHE and Modern Studies curriculum for KS2, KS3 and KS4 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and levels 2, 3 and 4 in Scotland. Summer explains the different types of epilepsy she has, including absence seizures and tonic-clonic seizures.

Four Owls scored in double figures tonight, including Stapleton, who scored 19 points and grabbed 9 rebounds. Big man Karlis Silins scored 14 points and grabbed 10 rebounds, completing a double-double in the game."
"The scenes that unfolded in Britain this week were undoubtedly shocking to a global audience. Looting and arson exposed the inner city landscapes of London, Birmingham, and Manchester, an image of England that is typically presented to the outside world through period dramas, Hugh Grant movies, or stories about Prince William and Kate Middleton. If this exposure was confusing to outsiders, it was equally perplexing to the British. The mood in Britain at the moment is a mix of anger, fear, and confusion. It's not that we're unaccustomed to riots; we are. England has had riots before, in the year of the royal wedding, 1981."

"Recent research has shown that after inducing Alzheimer's-like symptoms in mice, their cognitive function improved after receiving synthetic estrogen-like hormones. Dr. Christian Pike, associate professor of gerontology at the University of Southern California and leader of the research team, said: ""This synthetic hormone improves behavior in a way similar to estrogen."" However, although estrogen can cause uterine enlargement and is a known risk factor for uterine and breast cancer, PPT did not noticeably alter the reproductive tract of the animals. ""This may be a promising strategy to maximize the benefits of hormone therapy while minimizing its risks,"" Pike said."

"Abandoning the usual large-scale, over-budget outdoor concerts to promote their latest album, the rock band Oasis has begun hiring street performers to do their promotional work for them. Last Friday, a group of street performers were gathered to play Oasis' new songs at various locations in Manhattan. The motley crew included violinists, guitarists, and of course, some gold-painted human statues. They played in all five boroughs, from subway platforms to park plazas, and even in the pouring rain. Tos and Dominic Del Principe were among those who got soaked."
"In her weekly therapy sessions, Julie revealed her most uncomfortable secrets: depression, debt, childhood molestation. Her Massachusetts General Hospital psychiatrist would then enter a summary into Julie's computerized medical records. As a result, more than 200 pages of sensitive notes were made available for any doctor who had treated her to view within the shared healthcare network. It wasn't until a doctor later referenced the notes that Julie found out. Julie, a 43-year-old lawyer, initially felt uncomfortable and then became angry. ""These details are nobody's business,"" she said. But the shared healthcare company disagreed."
"In order for the private sector to be involved in healthcare, what is truly needed is a significant increase in public sector investment to cover more people. The country had a new healthcare policy after 14 years. Such a long interval itself indicates the priority, or lack thereof, given to an industry that urgently needs attention and is closely related to the country's rapid development and its vision of rising as a strong nation in the global order. The new policy proposed seven key transformations in healthcare service organizations, including the shift from selective to comprehensive primary healthcare, which is welcome and closely related to referral hospitals. Additionally, the new policy also emphasizes the importance of preventive care, public health, and healthcare services, as well as the role of medical information technology and electronic health records in improving healthcare services."
"The CEO of Vodafone Hutchison Australia, Iñaki Berroeta, is attempting to temper expectations around Australia's impending 5G rollout, stating that while the company is pushing ahead with its 5G deployment, he does not expect consumer devices to be available until the end of 2019. Berroeta declined to discuss VHA's spectrum ambitions in the Australian 5G space, instead emphasizing the need to establish a new ""ecosystem"" for mobile technology before operators begin spruiking products. He predicted that when 5G networks do launch, ""the majority of the market"" will do so within a one- to two-month window."
"A church in Schuylkill County is set to commemorate the late Father Walter Ciszek, S.J. this weekend. He was a priest from Shenandoah who is currently being considered for sainthood. This weekend, the Father Walter Ciszek Prayer League Center in Shenandoah will be bustling with activity. It is a museum showcasing the life of Ciszek, a Jesuit missionary who went to the Soviet Union, was accused of being a Vatican spy, and was imprisoned until he was returned to the United States in 1963. He died in 1984 at the age of 80. ""We think Father Ciszek was a very special person who dedicated his life to serving God and the Church. His experience in the Soviet Union was extremely difficult, but he never gave up his faith. He is a true hero and a model worth learning from."" The museum has collected many artifacts from Ciszek's life, including his clothes, books, and photos. These items allow people to better understand Ciszek's life and faith. The staff at the museum hopes that through these exhibits, more people will learn about Father Ciszek's story and draw inspiration from his life."
"I was just reminded of why I abandoned my career in financial journalism, including my stint as a reporter on Wall Street, after 11 years in the field. While the financial world has its fascinating aspects, I became disillusioned with the dominant narrative that governs it, which holds that the financial world revolves solely around money, rather than other considerations such as values and social impact, which never seemed to enter the picture. Given the testosterone-filled trading floors and the lives of city executives that are almost completely disconnected from those of ordinary people, it's not entirely surprising."
"A report to be released on Tuesday will detail how an unknown cyber hacker breached computers in South Carolina and stole tax returns for millions of residents over several years. NBC's Michael Isikoff reports. Columbia, South Carolina - Last August, staff at the South Carolina Department of Revenue received a malicious email that allowed an international hacker to gain access to the state's computers and obtain 3.8 million tax returns, including Social Security numbers and bank account information. Experts say it's the largest cyber-attack on a state government in history, according to details in the report to be released on Tuesday. According to the report, the attack was carried out through a phishing email that gave the hacker permission to enter the state's computer system and steal a large amount of sensitive information."
"Syria: Why is Assad's power expanding? In the presidential election held in early June, Assad was declared the winner with 88.7% of the vote. Given the nature of this regime, this is not unexpected. However, despite the fact that these elections were not ""free"" in any sense of the word, and many people were unable to vote because they were in refugee camps outside the country, the results suggest that a large part of the Syrian people still support Assad. Why is this? Stop the criminal attack on Gaza! Yesterday, the Israeli army launched a ground attack on Gaza."
"Butler made headlines last week after posting a letter signed by Barack Obama on her website, describing her as ""intelligent, wise and determined"". She later admitted that the words were crafted by her staff and Obama had simply signed it. Before entering the House of Commons, Butler was an official for the GMB union. She became the MP for Brent South in 2005, replacing Paul Boateng, and became the third black woman to be an MP. In September 2008, she was promoted to her current position. Butler is the daughter of Jamaican immigrants. She grew up in London, where her parents owned a small West Indian and European bakery."

Is the performance in the fifth season of the Indian Premier League related to money, nationality, or age? Puneet Monga and Srinivas Bhogle help us figure it out. One would expect expensive players to perform better. Is that really the case? Generally, yes. (As shown in the table below, there is a strong correlation between the overall player rankings and the ""high-cost"" player rankings).

"BlackBerry Ltd. has decided not to renew a licensing agreement that allowed T-Mobile US Inc. to sell its products. A promotional mishap last month led to a breakdown in the relationship between BlackBerry and T-Mobile, which had previously collaborated for many years. On Wednesday, BlackBerry announced that it would not renew the licensing agreement, which is set to expire on April 25. In February, T-Mobile offended the Canadian smartphone manufacturer by sending a message to its BlackBerry users, offering them an iPhone 5s with no upfront cost. The Seattle-based carrier later attempted to mend its relationship with BlackBerry through a second promotional offer, providing a $200 credit to BlackBerry users when they traded in their old devices for any new T-Mobile phone. BlackBerry stated that this decision would not affect its partnerships with other carriers."
"On November 17, 2015, at 12:55 am, Michael Hoppen had to change his habits that he formed in Manhattan. We realized that in Manhattan, the cost was too high for us. We looked everywhere and finally came to this area, and we found the houses here to be stunning and felt great. The owner who sold us the house, Rodney and Desmond, lived next door. They received several offers, and I think they might have wanted us to be their neighbors - a couple expecting a child, wanting to buy their first home. I believe this might have been more attractive than paying an extra 0.1% down payment."

Shortly after the acquisition, he founded Transmit Security. Interestingly, Boodae did not seek venture capital, stating that putting his own money and that of his co-founder Rakesh Loonkar into the startup made him feel like when he first started his first company, but this time without having to report to anyone else."

"Our readers weigh in on the U.S. bomb dropped on Afghanistan, the animal on the back of the Canadian quarter, and the Easter egg hunt in Ottawa. You can write to us at letters@ottawacitizen.com. Our guidelines are here. In the April 14 article ""U.S. drops 'mother of all bombs' on ISIL"", the media needs to report the news in a timely manner, but they don't have to use derogatory language to do so. I believe the person who gave this destructive weapon its nickname is neither a mother nor someone who respects mothers."

"Can drain pipes resolve compaction conflicts. How can we introduce more water into the Republican River. Can this be achieved by installing drain pipes in existing ranch water dams. 8 to 12 inch pipes can allow water in ranch water dams to slowly drain out and flow into the Republican River during rain events. Note: This solution does not remove any ranch water dams as they provide us with valuable services, but rather modify them. The pipes can be set at a height that allows water to be retained for livestock, wildlife, and other species."

"Washington — South Florida has long been a testing ground for some of the nation's most intense politics, with opponents employing tactics such as creating phantom candidates to siphon votes from adversaries, or hiring so-called boleteras, or vote brokers, to improperly fill out large numbers of absentee ballots for elderly or disabled voters. But the 2016 election cycle was unprecedented, with several Democratic congressional candidates becoming targets of Russian influence operations, and thousands of pages of documents stolen by hackers from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's Washington office being funneled to reporters and bloggers in Florida."

"I want to follow up on a question from a viewer because we just started a lively discussion about how to save big bucks. Recently, on GMA Weekend and ABC News Now, I reported on how hiring a medical bill advocate can help you find and correct hospital bill errors, saving you thousands of dollars. According to the Medical Billing Advocates of America, 80% of hospital bills contain errors. One of the biggest misconceptions about medical billing errors is that most insurance companies pay a fixed fee for hospital stays or surgeries."

Besides their close relationship with William, the two men had one thing in common: they both wanted to clear his name."
"Where America goes, Britain tends to follow, and this is especially true in negative ways. If America experiences extreme weather, we usually follow suit a few days later. If America's violent crime rate rises, so does ours. And then there's the shopping frenzy. Britain is adopting traditional American events such as the post-Christmas sales, leaving customers bankrupt and with yet another unwanted item. Black Friday has just passed, today is Cyber Monday, and every shopping day becomes part of the retail calendar on both sides of the Atlantic."
"It's been over a decade since Eminem played his sole leading role in the movie ""8 Mile"", and you could reasonably assume that his acting career began and ended there.

"On the East Coast, voters braved the cold, waiting in line to vote in the pre-dawn darkness, bringing to a close one of the most grueling and expensive campaigns in U.S. history.

At the Falls Church Community Center, more than 100 people had already been waiting for over half an hour by 6:00 a.m. local time, with the polling station set up in the gymnasium in the basement. ""The polling station is now open, go vote!"" they were told. They had to choose between two men with starkly different ideas for America's economic recovery."
"As a veteran of the climate change activism movement, I've grown accustomed to disappointment. So, when I was summoned to the office of the Senior Associate to the President of Stanford University as the organizational coordinator for Fossil Free Stanford, I attended the meeting with some trepidation. My concern was well-founded. Earlier that morning, Harvard University had arrested a student for demanding a public conversation about fossil fuel divestment. The previous fall, Brown University had flatly rejected students' calls to divest from the thirteen dirtiest coal companies. Efforts to implement climate policy at the national and international levels had fared no better."

A senior official stated that the police have doubts about whether he is the true perpetrator due to a lack of conclusive evidence supporting the theory."

"The airline operates 744 mainline aircraft, ranging in size from 50 to 366 seats. For a typical 737 jet with 179 passengers, this weight-saving measure means about 11 pounds less weight per flight.

This implies that United Airlines earned less than $2.3 million in revenue from selling these items on planes, or that allowing passengers to buy these items on the ground would have no significant impact on its revenue."

"The disputes between the US intelligence agencies and their elected President Donald Trump are not only bizarre but also a special case for assessing the principles that should guide the relationship between national intelligence and the political administration under a democratic system. In theory, an intelligence-based national security system is responsible for detecting and tracking any national security threats, whether external or internal, and committed to eliminating them. However, it operates under the authorization of an elected political administration, which is the ultimate sovereign. Under a democratic system, the political administration is the ultimate embodiment and representation of national sovereignty. Therefore, the relationship between the national security system and the political administration is complex and subtle, requiring a balance to be struck to ensure that the national security system can effectively perform its duties while also being subject to the supervision and restraint of the political administration. This balance is crucial for ensuring the effectiveness of the national security system and the healthy functioning of the democratic system."

I had expected to see sympathy and compassion, but as I read the comments, my heart sank. They were full of cruelty."
"Central American referee Carlos Batres put on the worst acting performance in the World Cup, and that's saying something for an Italian, being the second best actor after Federico Fellini, thus depriving the New Zealand All Whites of a historic victory over the current football world champions.

"Over the past five years, the internet has undergone changes beyond what people expected. It is no longer just a medium for browsing: it is filled with Web 2.0 applications, real-time communication challenges, and various threats that are designed to exploit this new way of use. As a result, network security has undergone incredible changes - simply blocking, stopping or suppressing IP sessions is no longer enough. Network filtering is unable to meet the security challenges. This webinar will explain the changes in the way the internet is used, and how your understanding of IT may not be in line with what users actually do, resulting in your security controls being bypassed."

What does this mean? Will's producer and ex-girlfriend Mackenzie McHale (Emily Mortimer) explains: ""Reclaiming the Fourth Estate""."
"The Israeli ambassador and almost all staff have been evacuated from the embassy in Amman, the Jordanian capital, amid fears of an attack similar to one that occurred in Egypt last week.

"My daughter is a resident advisor at her university and recently mentioned that she may be getting more foreign exchange students to oversee in the fall, and she was somewhat complaining about it. When I asked her why this was a bad thing, she said that foreign exchange students often think Americans are stupid unless they prove otherwise. They think Americans don't travel as widely as they do, aren't as fluent in foreign languages as they are, and aren't as knowledgeable about world cultures as they are. I said what any good American would say: why don't they just stay home? Oh, she replied, they don't think our universities are stupid."

"I strongly encourage the Mayor and City Council to continue their efforts to protect the South Central Corridor. This is the only decision that upholds the will of the voters, does not jeopardize Federal Transportation Administration funding, and strengthens the value of the Phoenix light rail. Leaders must remain consistent and continue to support this important project. This is the only sensible thing to do. Arizona has already approved all necessary health professional licenses to provide patients with a comprehensive approach to addressing chronic pain issues. Now is the time for healthcare professionals to work together in the best interest of the patients."

According to the law, registered practitioners can only legally perform abortions in New Zealand after obtaining a certificate approved by two certifying consultants appointed by the Abortion Supervisory Committee. The appeal also argues that the court erred in law in concluding that the committee can form its own opinion on the lawfulness of certifying consultants approving or declining abortions."

"Ricky Kalgard: You should focus on four areas. One is financial regulation, which still makes it difficult for small businesses to get loans. You mentioned healthcare regulation, Obamacare has increased the cost burden everywhere you look. Then there's environmental regulation, which is a broad field that's strangling small businesses, especially in California where I live. Farmers in California are being squeezed, supposedly to protect certain insects. And then you have labor regulation. Last year, we saw the National Labor Relations Board take action against Boeing."
"To create a ""diversionary event"", foreign forces attacked key power plants in Venezuela, María Zakharova explained, which ""have equipment made in Canada"".

"This June, the Tacoma Rainiers brought their reindeer mascot Rhubarb and local icon ""Epic Sax Gorilla"" to the roof of Cheney Stadium for a routine crowd-pleasing stunt. Tacoma News Tribune reporter Matt Driscoll also made it to the roof, and he recently explained how the rooftop dance led to his employer and the baseball team being fined thousands of dollars by the state Department of Labor and Industries. But in a heap of public documents I finally obtained, there's an email from an individual - it provides a more complete answer."
"Recently, my elderly mother went to the bank at the Eastland shopping center in Covina, California. When she left the bank, a woman carrying a baby approached her, asking for money to buy food, claiming she had just come from Italy and had no money or means of living.

The woman thanked her and then continued to beg from others in the parking lot."

"Can we put a price on faith? This is a question that believers are posing as the tradition of tithing - donating 10% of one's income to the church - faces increasing challenges. Opponents of tithing argue that it is a misinterpretation of the Bible, a human creation rather than God's will. They believe they should have the freedom to choose the amount they donate, and are therefore arguing with pastors, writing letters, and protesting by leaving the church. In response, some pastors are changing their teachings and rejecting a fundraising method that has been one of the most popular for decades."

"The Brazilian band Gurizada Fandangueira, known for its pyrotechnic displays on stage, may have inadvertently caused a fire at a nightclub in southern Brazil due to a cost-cutting measure, resulting in the deaths of more than 230 people. State police inspector Marcelo Arigony, who is leading the investigation into the deadly fire that occurred over the weekend, told reporters at a press conference on Tuesday that band members knowingly purchased flares that were only suitable for outdoor use because they cost only $1.25 each, while indoor flares cost $35.

"Several bills in the New Jersey Legislature have caught the attention of truckers and other road users in the state. Repeat offenders of drunk driving may soon face harsher penalties. Currently, New Jersey law only limits punishment for affected offenders to a traffic violation, with bail usually set at $2,500. Designating it as a traffic violation allows drivers charged with drunk driving to continue driving while waiting for their court date. A bill awaiting passage in the state legislature aims to put an end to this practice. Instead, A3057 would increase penalties for those convicted of drunk driving two or more times within 60 days, designating it as a fourth-degree crime."

"The Bible teaches us to ""resist the devil and he will flee from you"" (James 4:7), and at the same time, it tells us to stay away from those who are controlled by all kinds of evil desires (see 1 Timothy 3:5-6). Many great leaders in God's eyes have fallen into the temptation of the flesh and may have ruined their lives and ministries. Someone said, ""It takes a lifetime to build integrity, but only a minute to lose it."" This is a true statement! I believe one of the main reasons leaders fall is that most leaders have never intentionally built a firewall in their minds and emotions."

"The band Led Zeppelin plagiarized from the 60's band Spirit? ""The Voice"" plagiarized from ""American Idol""? In a recent lawsuit, the heirs of the composer of the song ""Taurus"" claimed that ""Stairway To Heaven"" infringed on copyright law. Creators have been borrowing from each other for centuries. But what is the real harm - is it financial, artistic, or something else? How much of the original work is transplanted into the new work? That's always a gray area. Music copyright lawsuits have been going on for over a century."
"The detailed upgrade process, I hope it's helpful to you if you don't have this experience before. Let me be in charge of disassembling the screws at the back, being careful with the keyboard sliding connection to the blue connector, and gently pulling it out. Disassemble the back again, and start disassembling the screws. Take out the bracket. Now start replacing the solid-state drive. Great, the solid-state drive matches the slot perfectly. Tighten the screws to secure the solid-state drive. Evaluate the performance of the solid-state drive, it surprises me again, with a score of 7.8. As far as I know, the highest score is 7.9."

She previously served as editor-in-chief of the Columbia Journal and blog editor of Asymptote and Words Without Borders. If Baudelaire were alive, reading Alejandra Pizarnik's work would have given him nightmares.

"The rally video shot by Ken Block is extremely stunning. However, the New South Wales police did not want Ken Block to shoot this particular rally video in Sydney - the one you see above. The Hoonigan team turned to New York instead, leaving Australia behind. Here's the video they shot - which could have been done with the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Opera House, and our most iconic landmarks as the backdrop. Ken Block's Gymkhana Nine was shot to coincide with the release of the video game Forza Horizon 3, which is set in Australia - so it made sense to shoot Gymkhana Nine in Australia."

"The photographs of Yemen we published may be the most disturbing we have ever published. Here's why we decided to publish them.

Amal's body was extremely thin, her head tilted to one side, as if she couldn't bear to face the person staring at her directly. Some readers may have had the same impulse to look away."

"January 29, 2015: Follow the money. One reason the new peace talks are making progress is that the factions that control most of the population are willing to make concessions if it will help stop the rapid decline in the standard of living nationwide. The fighting between factions, especially the two governments that claim to rule the entire country, has led to a shrinkage in economic activity and an increase in shortages. Then there's the violence from Islamic terrorism. While most Libyans are grateful for the help Islamic terrorists provided in 2011 to overthrow Kaddafi, since then these groups have become a greater menace than Kaddafi's secret police."
