"Voter fraud has been confirmed in several states, including Mississippi. Louisiana's top election official is warning residents about a potential scam to obtain sensitive information from potential voters after similar concerns in several other states. The scam involves a caller claiming to work for a voter registration assistance organization. The callers offer to register residents over the phone and in some cases send the voter an absentee ballot, said Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin. According to state law, residents cannot register to vote or request an absentee ballot over the phone."
"For small businesses that sell on credit, accounts receivable can constitute a substantial portion of the balance sheet. During the annual audit, auditors will verify if their assertions regarding the accounts receivable balance can be proven. These assertions are known as assertions. The most common audit procedure related to accounts receivable is confirmation, in which the auditor will ask their clients to confirm their account balance. Knowing which assertions can be proven by confirmation can help you understand why your auditor requests multiple audit procedures on the same account. Accounts receivable confirmations primarily serve to prove the existence assertion."
"It's a good thing you're not Jim Furyk today. 1. The American team entered Sunday with a huge four-point lead in the Ryder Cup, and the local fans were expecting to enjoy another dominant day. 2. Luke Donald won the first match of the day over Bubba Watson, to make the score 10-7. Still, the United States has a big lead. Whatever. 3. Europe's Paul Lawrie swept the floor with Brandt Snedeker for another European point. 4. At least Keegan Bradley, the best player on the US team all weekend, was putting up a fight against Rory McIlroy."
"It happens: you press the snooze button once, twice, and then three times, so that when you've finally showered, dressed, and are ready to face the day, you're already running behind schedule. Many times, that makes you skip breakfast altogether. It turns out that your breakfast habit is a time-saving measure that shouldn't be skipped. Firstly, eating a nutritious, high-protein, and balanced breakfast every morning is a proven way to give your brain a boost, improving concentration and performance. Additionally, breakfast is associated with better weight control, as it provides energy to your body and can reduce hunger later in the day."
"Dublin: Lawmakers voted overwhelmingly on Friday to back Ireland's first abortion bill, legalizing the practice in exceptional cases where doctors deem a woman's life at risk due to her pregnancy, as the predominantly Catholic country took its first legislative step away from a total ban. Exhausted lawmakers applauded the 127-31 Friday vote, while outside the gates of parliament, pro-abortion rights activists cheered as they watched the result on their smartphones. It brought an end to an exhausting debate that kept lawmakers in discussion from Wednesday morning until 5am on Thursday and, after a sleep break, until midnight on Friday."
"The best Halloween costumes are inspired by the most memorable moments of the year, and 2016 has been nothing if not memorable. We've had the Summer Olympics and a U.S. presidential election, which dominate headlines (and Facebook timelines) every four years. Add in a visually stunning Beyoncé album, the hysteria surrounding Pokémon Go, and the colorful, quotable madness of Suicide Squad, and 2016 is basically begging for a Halloween costume extravaganza. We've become experts in all things Halloween, producing over a billion page views of Halloween content. That's where we come in."

World Cup debutants Iceland, are dreaming of the knockout stage and are writing a new chapter in one of the most notable stories in international football in recent years. On their path is not only Nigeria, who are desperate for a win after losing their opening match 2-0 to Croatia, but also the challenge of the scorching temperatures in the southern Russian city."
"A pair of Metro Vancouver thieves have been arrested and charged after they allegedly carried out a prolonged period of mail theft and identity theft. After the Coquitlam RCMP and Canadian postal inspectors worked together to investigate the thefts, investigators identified a prime suspect, made arrests, and used search warrants to acquire a large amount of evidence, according to a November 11 press release from the Coquitlam RCMP. Heine Hut, a 49-year-old Surrey man who is well-known to police, faces six charges including mail theft, unlawful use of a mail key, and possession of stolen mail and a stolen credit card."
"First, we examine which major brands cost more to maintain over the first 10 years of a car's life. We grouped all the years of all models by brand to calculate their average cost per brand. In order to estimate annual maintenance costs, we found the amount spent on each two oil changes (since oil changes are generally done every six months). German imports head the list with a considerable advantage, which is not too surprising. Toyota and its two brands, Lexus and Scion, are among the cheapest, saving owners at least $10,000 in ten years compared to a BMW."

"Veteran Congressman Jim Leach (R-IA) fell defeated in the 2006 massacre. I am not a proponent of ""moderate Republicans"", but it is worth saying that Leach was, in my estimation, clearly the best Republican in the House of Representatives. However, one can only be excited about his defeat. That it happened only demonstrates how fundamentally rotten the entire GOP scene had become. Leach was, in many ways, a person with genuinely decent instincts and some fundamentally sound ideas about how the United States should conduct itself in the world. However, in practice he was useless."
"Donald Trump's tweets have long raised questions about whether they violate Twitter's rules that prohibit abusive behavior on the service. On Monday, after a Trump tweet threatened that North Korea might ""not be around much longer"", Twitter was forced to explain why the president wasn't kicked off the service. In a six-part tweet from Twitter's public policy account, the company said that Twitter takes into account ""newsworthiness"" and ""public interest"" when determining whether a user has violated its rules. These considerations have long been used internally when deciding the fate of a problematic user, Twitter said."
"No one can accurately predict when the stock markets will end their record bull run. But the best way for investors to face the next downturn is to remain calm and stick to a well-thought-out plan. The Star asked Ashley Feinstein Gerstley, author of 30-Day Money Cleanse: Take Control of Your Finances, Manage Your Spending, and Reduce Financial Stress for Good, about why people have so much trouble managing their own finances, and how they can do it better. There are also other common expenses that people tend to overlook or incorrectly report by accident."

"South Bend (IN) -- On Thursday morning, the Irish took to the practice field for the last time before Saturday's Blue-Gold game. One of the biggest questions the team faced entering spring ball still hasn't been answered: who will take over at the linebacker position? Defensive coordinator Clark Lea said fifth-year linebacker Asmar Bilal is the closest the unit has to anything 'absolute' at the moment, but he seems fine with the uncertainty. He believes the position has made great strides over the last month and a half, but he's in no rush to have everything in place with Week 1 still months away."
"This month, Drake wrapped up his residency at the O2 Arena in London. But he wasn't ready to fly back across the pond and head home just yet. Instead, over the weekend, he joined Tiffany Calver, who hosts the BBC 1Xtra rap show and became her co-host for the day. While he was there, he talked about a wide range of things. He talked about the early days of his career and even addressed rumors about him being a culture vulture because he appropriates British and Caribbean cultures. But the most interesting thing, well, for us Africans anyway, was his shoutout to Niniola."

"It is hard to understate the success and growing power of Amazon. Its market capitalization remains just below $1 trillion. Its growth rates have been astounding. By most estimates, Amazon now accounts for nearly 50% of all e-commerce revenue in the U.S., around 5% of all retail, and is significantly larger than its next 10 competitors combined. One study found that about 55% of all online product searches start on Amazon. This week, a report that Amazon is considering opening up to 3,000 of its cashier-less Amazon Go convenience stores by 2021 drew a lot of attention, even though they have only opened a fourth location a few days ago."
"NEW YORK — A lawyer who launched a tirade against Spanish-speaking workers at a New York City restaurant issued an apology on Tuesday. ""To the people I offended, I apologize. Seeing myself online opened my eyes — the way I expressed myself is unacceptable and is not who I am. I see that my words and actions hurt people, and for that I deeply apologize. While people should be able to express themselves freely, they should do so in a calm and respectful manner. What the video did not convey is the real me. I am not racist."
"Some applications aim to change the world, while others are bent on bringing beauty to your pocket devices. Beautiful Clock Widgets falls into the latter category. This small Android application does exactly what it says on the label, with a collection of clock widgets with the option of additional data, such as local weather and battery information. Some are great, others are fun... and a handful are downright eccentric. It's worth mentioning here that some are only available through the Pro Version, which costs $1.26, or its equivalent in local currency."

"It is not unusual to read and hear complaints about the amount of insults and disqualifications that the two main parties utter, a phenomenon that seems to magnify during electoral campaigns. And yet, these two parties rarely actively seek to engage in real insults and disqualifications. And with that, I mean talking about trash in the literal sense! And yet, the issue of trash and waste in general is one that affects us all, touching on issues of public health, social cohesion, and tourism, among others."
"ZAMBOANGA CITY—Terror is lurking among the residents of Pata Island in Sulu and it does not come from extremists, but from politicians.

""We are powerless,"" said 60-year-old Bidin Jubail, a resident of Saimbangon, one of the villages on Pata Island. Jubail recalled an attack on the island on January 2, allegedly by Burahan's followers, who were armed with an M203 grenade launcher, and M-14 and M-16 rifles."
"German business confidence plummeted in October to its lowest level in more than 2 and a half years, the sixth consecutive decline that dispels any lingering doubt that Europe's largest economy is now mired in the euro zone debt crisis.

"The life of the mind puzzles poets and neuroscientists who are dedicated to tracing and labeling it, and, in my case, trying to find it. Thought itself is something that is to be considered in the Irish tradition and, therefore, there are many concepts in the Irish language related to the mind, dreams, and imagination. I'm just a student, so many of the nuances will be lost on me, but language is about conversation. I would love to hear native speakers offer more sophisticated thoughts on the vocabulary of Irish thought."
"According to analysts, the market is entering a consolidation phase after the recent increase. NEW DELHI: A below-normal monsoon forecast by private weather agency Skymet proved to be a major dampener for stock market indices on Wednesday, which gave up the day's gains after hitting record highs. According to Skymet, the 2019 monsoon is likely to be 'below normal' at 93 percent of the long-term average (LPA) of 887 mm over four months from June to September. This sent the bulls tumbling downwards, erasing previous gains, as the market ended in negative territory."

"OTTAWA, March 20 (Reuters) - In a new blow to the embattled government of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a legislator left his ruling Liberal Party to sit as an independent on Wednesday after defending a former minister at the center of a political scandal. Trudeau has been on the defensive since February 7 over accusations that top officials working for him pressured former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to ensure that construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc would avoid a corruption trial.

"The Grant bar and grill is a lively spot with local musicians playing on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights and Sunday afternoons on the outdoor dining patio. If The Old Fish House could talk, just imagine the fascinating stories it would share about 100 years of residing on the Indian River estuary. It could tell us about the early days when entire families would sleep on their fishing boats. We would hear tales of dawn on the river, of husbands taking those same boats and joining the fishing fleet heading out to sea while families stayed behind with wives working hard in the fish house, processing fish."

"Maureen Wildes argues that it's time to uncover the true impact of the Vietnam War on the children of veterans. Like many other children of veterans, I am also a statistic. If this study had been carried out years ago, when it should have been done, perhaps I would have realized what was happening to me, not to mention my father. Hello, I am the wife of a Vietnam veteran, I have 3 children. The first daughter is from my first marriage when I was 18 years old and the next 2 girls are from my second marriage in 1970."

Cuomo has two Twitter accounts, one with 853,000 followers and the other with 10,400.

"Less than two years ago, I was sitting at a South Atlantic League (Single-A) baseball game between the Hagerstown Suns and the visiting Greensboro Grasshoppers. Behind me were two Greensboro pitchers, Trevor Richards and Ben Meyer. They were following the game. As I discussed in this post, neither of the pitchers seemed destined for the big leagues. Richards had not been drafted in 2015 out of a small college, and therefore had to start his career with the Gateway Grizzlies of the Frontier League, an independent league. The Miami Marlins signed him in 2016 and he was pitching well for Greensboro."

What does the UN expect to find from this investigation? What actions would the UN be willing to take?"

"Without a doubt, the addiction drama ""Beautiful Boy"" – and not the horror movie ""Halloween"" – is the scariest movie opening in the multiplex this weekend. Starring Steve Carell (""Foxcatcher"") and Timothée Chalamet (""Call Me by Your Name""), the film is a chilling and disturbing look at a young man's fall into methamphetamine addiction (and heroin, pills, marijuana, etc.) and the efforts of a devoted father to save him. It's a true and terrifying story so powerful that neither an uninspired director nor a clichéd script can diminish its impact."

While many may think that eating well and exercising are the keys to aging well, the International Journal of Psychogeriatrics has found that certain personality traits can have a great impact on their life as they age, as well. We all have busy lives, but if you have recently moved your loved one into an assisted living home or a memory care cottage, it is even more important to stay connected with them. Nutrition is important in everyone's life, but especially in older adults."

They pointed to a paragraph in the draft resolution that welcomes the creation of South Sudan."
"There is no stronger motivation to forget differences than pending grades and contract negotiations. High above Midtown Manhattan, the favorite candidate in the Republican presidential race and the leading woman in prime-time news met to settle a pending account. Donald Trump and Megyn Kelly, who have spent the best part of the election cycle publicly fighting, privately seething, or mutually ignoring each other, met at Trump Tower on Monday, apparently ending the silence between them. ""Yes, the doormen seemed a bit stunned when I walked in,"" Kelly said on her Fox News program on Wednesday night."
"Seabees from Naval Mobile Construction Battalion (NMCB) 7 and members of Alpha Company, 427th Brigade Support Battalion, U.S. Army, stand in formation during a transfer ceremony at Camp Moreell, in Southwest Asia, May 23. Seabees operated Camp Moreell, named in honor of Admiral Ben Moreell, ""Father of the Seabees,"" for nearly 10 years as the Seabees' main land-based hub and gathering point for many sailors deploying throughout Southwest Asia before transferring responsibilities to the Army. The main hub for Seabee deployments to and from Iraq and Afghanistan was closed during a ceremony held at Ali Al Salem Air Base, Kuwait, May 23."
"The University of Sri Jayewardenepura celebrated 60 years of excellence in higher education on 18 February 2019, reaching a significant milestone in its historical journey. The Diamond Jubilee will be celebrated with the participation of President Maithreepala Sirisena, Chancellor, the Most Venerable Dr. Ittapana Dhammalankara, Vice Chancellor of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Senior Professor Sampath Amaratunge and other dignitaries at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) on 2 April 2019. The rich and vibrant history of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, initially as Vidyodaya Pirivena, dates back to 1873."
"Magic — that's the best way to describe the Hurricanes Championship victory of Lytton High School's Rugby Academy. In only the second year of the academy, Lytton's under-15 girls, coached by Trish Hina, defeated Wanganui 66-0, Feilding 42-0, and Kapiti 49-0 on Day 1. On Day 2, they defeated the Wairarapa-Bush combination 61-0 and Mana College 73-5 before defeating Feilding 63-10 in the final. The Lytton team is a tight unit and conceded only three tries in six games. ""The girls have worked very hard to get where they are now,"" said Hina, a former Black Fern."
"Vodafone has announced changes to its data roaming charges. The new changes will benefit those who use less than 5MB of data per day while abroad. The daily network charge in Europe from June 15 will be £1 per megabyte for the first 5MB, and then £5 for every additional 5MB. Outside of Europe, the charge is £3 per megabyte for the first 5MB, and then £15 for every additional 5MB. The changes will benefit those with minimal data requirements, but those who need to be connected to the internet at all times will pay more for the privilege."
"PREBLE COUNTY — With two serious accidents involving youths occurring in Preble County in the last week, Preble County Sheriff Mike Simpson spoke about summer driving practices as younger and less experienced drivers become more active during the summer. According to Simpson, during the summer, the roads tend to become more active and younger drivers tend to be on the road more because they are no longer in school. ""With kids out of school or kids back from college, there are many more young drivers on the roads going to and from events or to work now that they're not in school 6-7 hours a day,"" Simpson said."
"The relatives of the deceased listened with bravery while the circumstances of the deaths were heard in detail. Heart-wrenching details of how the Clutha helicopter crash victims died were read out at today's Fatal Accident Inquiry. It came in a joint minute of agreement - a legal mechanism meaning the Crown and 14 other legal parties in the inquiry will not question the details. Gary Arthur, 48, a sales advisor, was found in the pub trapped by debris. He had no pulse when he was found by rescue teams. A post-mortem found he had died from head injuries."
"The State Correction Board in a special meeting convened this morning voted unanimously to appoint interim chief Kevin Murphy as the permanent head of the Department of Community Correction. There was no change in his existing salary of $123,380. Murphy was put in charge after Governor Asa Hutchinson fired Sheila Sharp for questioning the agency's parole and probation staffing sufficiency. Murphy brings an irregular resume to the job. At one point, he had a deal being paid by a non-profit organization that worked on behalf of agency employees and was also receiving retirement from the Department of Corrections."
"Californians, of all people, should recognize what it means to expel people from their land. In the 1850s and 1860s, the state funded annual expeditions that emptied entire areas of their Native American presence. But this is not just a historical phenomenon: In the West Bank, Israeli settlers and the Israeli government have been trying for decades to eradicate the small Palestinian village of Susiya. The village has existed near Hebron since at least the 19th century. In the 1980s, it was declared an archaeological site to allow settlers to move in and replace the ancient inhabitants."
"President Nabih Berri and the Syrian ambassador to Lebanon discussed on Friday the ""Israeli-Western plans"" in the Syrian civil war, according to a statement from Berri's office. The Lebanese army established a security cordon on Friday in preparation to blow up an arsenal of old weapons found in the Sinniq area of Sidon. Lebanese workers staged 28 strikes and 121 protests in 2018, including strikes at the state electricity provider Electricite Du Liban and the Lebanese University, a rights monitor reported on Friday. An Iranian citizen has been arrested in Beirut on charges of human trafficking and forgery of legal documents, according to a report published in the Asharq al-Awsat newspaper on Friday."
"Every year, the local and state authorities ensure that Bangaloreans are warned about safety before Diwali. However, like in previous years, more than 60 firecracker-related victims have already been reported in the city this year as well. Surprisingly, this year children between 4 and 14 years old have suffered eye injuries as a result of ignoring fire safety precautions. The city has been lit up since Tuesday with the festive spirit, but the city's hospitals have received a total of 60 firecracker-related victims. Adding to this number, however, local clinics in several residential areas have been attending to patients who arrive daily since yesterday."
"Bhubaneswar: Shashi Bhushan Behera, Finance and Excise Minister, has expressed hope that IOCL will participate in the special purpose vehicles created for the development of PCPIR in Paradip and also in the Plastic Park in Paradip through equity participation. Moreover, IOCL should work on an attractive pricing mechanism for raw materials to encourage units to set up in Paradip. The state government has also requested the Ministry of Chemical and Petrochemicals of the Government of India to provide budgetary support of at least 3000 crore rupees to carry out the necessary infrastructure development activities for the region, said Sri Behera."
"A popular Belgian waffle franchise has opened in Dubai with the help of the government agency to support small and medium-sized enterprises. Yummy Waffles Cafe opened in Dubai Festival City on Sunday under a franchise agreement with Dubai SME, the agency of the Department of Economic Development in charge of developing the small and medium-sized enterprise sector. The cafe is part of the So Good Company franchise, known for making waffle batter. It already has stores across Europe and in North America, South Africa, Turkey, Hong Kong, and mainland China. President Abdul Salam Hammadi said that the Dubai cafe will also serve some Arabic flavors."
"Avid has 'redesigned and rebuilt' Media Composer, relaunching it to attract future generations of editors. At the company's Avid Connect event, held in Las Vegas just before NAB 2019, Avid unveiled Media Composer 2019, which has been designed to try to keep current and future users satisfied. Avid describes Media Composer 2019 as providing ""a new user experience"", with a customizable role-based user interface. Avid's bins have been redesigned and the software now features task-based workspaces, which only show the things the user might need for that task."
"A cancer expert has found a way to kill tumors in two hours, using light. The technique involves a single injection with a chemical and then a flash of ultraviolet light. It was found that cancer cells in laboratory mice self-destructed, with up to 95 percent dead in two hours. Professor Matthew Gdovin revealed that the cells, which he injected with the chemical compound nitrobenzaldehyde, became too acidic to survive. He said after patenting his ""photodynamic"" therapy: ""There are many different types of cancer. What they have in common is their susceptibility to this induced cell suicide."""
"Drones come in a wide variety of different shapes and sizes today, but in general, most of them still fall into one of two categories. There are those of the multirotor variety (quadcopters, hexacopters, octocopters, etc.), and those of the winged variety. Both categories have their own advantages and disadvantages. Multirotor aircraft tend to be more stable and easier to fly, but also much slower than winged drones that focus on forward acceleration. In contrast, winged drones can fly faster and farther than their hovering counterparts, but are more difficult to pilot, as they cannot perform vertical takeoffs and landings."
"BASEL, Switzerland – Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche Holding AG said on Monday that it has received reports of 13 cases of H1N1 flu that have become resistant to Tamiflu, which it describes as a very low percentage. A good sign is that people who had the resistant strain did not transmit the disease to other people, said David Reddy, leader of Roche's Tamiflu pandemic task force. And the resistant variety has been similar to the widespread version of the virus in the sense that it generally only produces mild symptoms. The 13 cases were scattered around the world in Europe, the United States, and Asia, said Reddy."
"Russian President Vladimir Putin described the downing of a Russian fighter jet by Turkey today (November 24) as a stab in the back administered by ""accomplices of terrorists"", and said the incident would have serious consequences. Speaking in the Russian city of Sochi, on the Black Sea, on Tuesday before a meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah, Putin said the downed plane had been attacked within Syria when it was 1 kilometer from the Turkish border and had fallen 4 kilometers inside Syria. This contradicts Turkey's claim that the aircraft had been warned multiple times that it was entering Turkish airspace before being shot down."
"Arsène Wenger believes the return to fitness of English striker Theo Walcott and the imminent recovery of German international Lukas Podolski means that Arsenal are not under additional pressure to buy another striker in January. The Gunners resume domestic action on Saturday with the intention of responding to the 1-0 defeat at Manchester United with a win over third-placed Southampton to stay top of the Barclays Premier League. Walcott is set to face his former club after spending around two months on the sidelines with an abdominal problem that required surgery. Podolski, on the other hand, is on course to be available again by late December after being out since August 27 with a hamstring tendon injury."
"The New York Knicks are approaching the quarter mark of the schedule with a mediocre 9-9 record, as they seek to end their 43-year championship drought. Coach Jeff Hornacek and the Knicks will have the upper hand over opponents in December. In the 15 games they will play this month, only five of them will be against teams with winning records. They will host the Minnesota Timberwolves, who have a 5-13 record, on Friday. Joakim Noah, Derrick Rose, and Carmelo Anthony are probably the biggest names on the roster, but they are not playing up to expectations. Anthony's team-leading scoring average of 22.2 points is slightly higher than last season's."
"The Hashemite Library remained as a beacon of knowledge and a destination for readers and intellectuals until 2000, when the number of readers began to decline, given the difficult economic situation in the Strip. In the 1950s, the Hashemite Library was commissioned to sell newspapers and books from prominent Egyptian publishing and distribution houses. It was also a space for writers and intellectuals to gather. However, the invasion of the Internet and the poverty of the inhabitants of the Gaza Strip have inhibited these activities. ""Due to the rise of the Internet and economic stagnation, we no longer receive books to distribute or sell."
"Google has long had a tense relationship with China, with the search giant largely withdrawing from the Chinese market after alleging that state-backed hackers had targeted the company's systems and employees. The forthcoming book by chairman Eric Schmidt, ""The New Digital Age"", is not going to smooth things over, according to a description of the book by The Wall Street Journal, which has reviewed galley proofs of the unpublished title. ""... in this world of total internet, China, the book says over and over, is a menacing and threatening superpower"", writes Tom Gara."
"Ray Trew has resigned as chairman of Notts County and announced that the League Two club is up for sale. Trew became owner and chairman in 2010, but said he took the decision after his family was subjected to ""senseless insults and abuse"" in recent days. Notts, who appointed Jamie Fullarton as manager in January, are 16th in League Two after being relegated last season. BBC Radio Nottingham reports that local businessman Alan Hardy is in talks to buy the club. ""It is with very mixed emotions that I announce the end of my tenure,"" Trew wrote in an open letter to fans."
"Warning: There are graphic images in the video above. SODUS, N.Y. (WHEC) -- A new leadership team promised changes were being made, but complaints about care and conditions inside the Sodus Rehabilitation and Nursing Center continue to come in. News10NBC has been investigating the facility and its record for over a year and, although administration was replaced last summer, families continue to find serious safety concerns inside. Joi Ann Mitchell-Kinley is the daughter of Bill Tanner's best friend, so when her father died, Bill took her under his wing."
"Do you want to end the war on whistleblowers? Review the Espionage Act. Over the past 100 years, the law has metastasized into a tool for government secrecy. The evolution of the Espionage Act has done much to shape the freedom of political debate in modern U.S. What began as a vague statute that gave President Woodrow Wilson the power to jail critics and censor the media during World War I has transformed into a powerful law that regulates political discourse through the surveillance of secrets, not freedom of speech. Censorship did not end when the war ended. It evolved. Despite its name, the Espionage Act has always been a broad statute."
"Google is trying to save presentation audiences from having to sit through long and rambling questions with a new feature it added to its Slides software on Wednesday. Slides Q&A will allow audiences to send text questions via the web while listening to a presentation using Google's software. As the presenter speaks, she can see the questions and respond to them, without having to wait for someone to speak into a microphone. The presenter view of Google Slides Q&A allows presenters to see what people in their audience want to know. In addition to sending questions, audience members can also vote on which ones they want to be answered."
"Manfred Weber (41) is the newly elected president of the European People's Party (EPP), the largest political group represented in the European Parliament after the 2014 elections. He originates from the conservative Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) of Germany. Weber spoke with Dario Sarmadi of EURACTIV Germany. David Cameron wants the UK to leave the EU if Jean-Claude Juncker becomes President of the European Commission. What would you say to the British Prime Minister? The UK belongs to the EU – and is, in itself, stronger within the community."
"When Conservative Party leader William Hague made his way through the crowd of faithful at a Tuesday noon rally and an emcee introduced him as ""the next prime minister of Britain"", even many of his supporters let out an involuntary chuckle. The conservative London daily The Times had for the first time thrown its support behind the Labour Party, backing Prime Minister Tony Blair for a second term. The country's leading bookmaker, Ladbrokes, had already closed its book on Thursday's election and said it had begun paying out on a Labour victory."
"April 24, 2014, 10:30 a.m.
In some smart legacy news companies, there is growth in digital advertising and smart strategy. But most newspaper companies are finding that the important numbers are still going in the wrong direction. By Ken Doctor @kdoctor April 24, 2014, 10:30 a.m.
As we approach the mid-point of the 2010s, where do newspapers find themselves in the battle for the largest advertising sector in the United States - digital? And how are all those paywalls working out? Two reports fell into the public domain within a week of each other recently, and together, they help us answer both questions."
"From the M1917 to the M1A2, American tanks have dominated the battlefield. The US Army and Marine Corps are about to celebrate a centennial: the 100th anniversary of the tank in US service. This animated GIF, created by the people at partcatalog.com, shows the evolution of the American tank: from the light tank M1917 to the M1A2 Abrams, and shows how the US went from being a newcomer to the world of tanks to a world leader. The light tank M1917, for example, was simply a copy of the Renault FT-17. That kind of copycat engineering is an idea that would be unthinkable now."
"The most prominent name among all these groups is that of Bajrang Dal, whose activists burned alive an Australian missionary, Graham Staines, along with his two young sons in Orissa in 1999. This moving event is cited as an early example of saffron terror in India. The ugly face of Hindu terrorism has resurfaced again with the arrest of three people in Maharashtra for conspiring to carry out ""terrorist activities"" in various places in the state. According to the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), 22 items have been recovered from the accused's house in Pune."
"Look for... Ron Brown from AAG Archaeology with the Netty door. Next, the Westoe Netty painting. A recovered toilet door from a historic building in South Tyneside now takes pride of place in one of the northeast's most popular visitor attractions. During a study of a Regency-era farmhouse on Beach Road, South Shields, staff from northeast company AAG Archaeology found what is possibly the only toilet door to form part of a museum collection. It was eagle-eyed archaeologist Ron Brown who spotted what is believed to be the finest surviving example of a classic northeast netty door, protruding from the rubble of a demolished toilet."
"The best element of M. Night Shyamalan's 2017 horror film Split - and one of the few things it did well - happened at the end. The brief and surprising revelation of Bruce Willis reprising his character David Dunn from Unbreakable created a shared universe that Shyamalan was too eager to exploit. Unfortunately, there's a huge chasm between teasing fans with a fleeting appearance and building a story around it. Glass, the third film in what has become a trilogy, seems like a mishmash of half-baked ideas in an uneven pie."

"Sign the RootsAction petition to the mayors and police chiefs of the nation to affirm your support for the right to unrestricted peaceful protest. Occupy Wall Street protesters won a big victory on Friday when Mayor Bloomberg and Brookfield Properties, the owners of New York City's Zuccotti Park, backed down from their demand that activists temporarily leave the park for a cleaning and then comply with new rules that banned sleeping bags, much of the equipment, and even lying down on the premises. Protesters in numerous other cities were not as lucky."
"The transmission products RealAudio and RealVideo of Progressive Networks received a boost today with the news that Microsoft plans to make a minority investment in the company and license its key products, RealAudio and RealVideo 4.0. As part of the agreement, Microsoft will incorporate Progressive technologies into the Internet Explorer clients and the NetShow streaming server, and the companies will collaborate to make their respective server and client products work together. In turn, Progressive will support Microsoft's Active Streaming Format (ASF) as well as its own file formats, and will use Microsoft's DirectShow and DirectDraw APIs and other technologies in future versions of its Windows clients."
"ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) - Mike Minor was able to finish what he started, something the left-hander never had the opportunity to do for the Texas Rangers last season in his return to a rotation. The Angels have a record of 2-14 in their last 16 road games since last September - a period in which they have a record of 12-2 at home. ... The Rangers have hit home runs in all their 10 home games, the longest home run streak to start a season in Texas history. ... It was the second shutout of the season for Texas, both at home after having just one home shutout victory last season."
"January 5, 2017, 11 a.m. Box V2 scans for weak passwords and prevents you from accidentally sending personal data to fake sites. LAS VEGAS—Bitdefender has updated its network security device, now known as New Bitdefender Box or Box Version 2, which is designed to protect home networks and Internet of Things devices from external attacks. The original Bitdefender Box extended security protection to devices that could not run antivirus software on their own, specifically Internet of Things devices. By moving security protection to the network level, Box products protect all devices on the network, including refrigerators, game consoles, and security cameras."
"Technology executives are discussing the impact that automation technologies are having on their organizations. For many organizations and their workers, technology automation is both an opportunity and a threat. On one hand, the use of robotic process automation and other tools creates efficiencies by automating manual and repetitive tasks. On the other, it has the potential to make jobs redundant. Technology executives gathered at roundtable events in Sydney and Melbourne recently to discuss the impact that automation technologies are having on their organizations. A key theme raised during the discussion was the challenge of ensuring that governance policies and procedures are still followed as ""bots"" replace tasks performed by humans across the enterprise."
"Baceapp Corp. and LightSpin Technologies will be moving into the BU's Engineering and Science Building. The two companies plan to create 39 jobs and invest $540,000 over the next five years while residing in tax-free zones at Binghamton University, Governor Andrew Cuomo's office announced on Monday. Baceapp Corp. and LightSpin Technologies Inc., which will be moving into BU's Engineering and Science Building, were two of the 17 companies unveiled on Monday as new participants in Start-Up NY, a program that offers tax-free status for 10 years in locations near or on university campuses."
"WASHINGTON, March 1 - After a year of record natural disasters that exceeded $1 billion, representatives of major insurance companies said today that the costs to taxpayers and businesses due to extreme weather will continue to rise because of climate change. Insurers joined Senators Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) at a press conference to discuss the growing financial impact of global warming. Both Vermont and Rhode Island felt the impact of Tropical Storm Irene last August, one of 14 record natural disasters in the United States last year, each causing more than $1 billion in damage."
"It was another quarter of rapid growth for the optical equipment manufacturer, but shares fell as investors weren't inspired by the revenue forecast. Infinera (NASDAQ:INFN) reported its Q1 results on April 27 after the market close. While the results slightly beat its own projections, traders were selling shares in Thursday trading, as the company projected that growth would slow in the next quarter. By 3:40 p.m., shares had fallen nearly 24% from the previous close. Let's break down the results to see how the company performed in the three areas I suggested investors should keep an eye on."
"Edgar Wright has never made a bad film, not even a less than very good one, and it therefore makes sense that up until now in his career, Wright has steered clear of direct sequels. However, that could possibly change with Baby Driver. When Shaun of the Dead was a massive hit, rather than capitalizing on that with a zombie sequel, Wright, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost instead made a thematically connected trilogy - the Cornetto Trilogy - with the also excellent Hot Fuzz and The World's End."
"The TTP apparently cannot fund its operations due to lack of money. ISLAMABAD: The Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) is facing a severe financial crisis since its late founder leader Baitullah Mehsud combined several scattered groups from across the tribal region to form the most feared network of homegrown militants back in 2007. ""The Taliban have been left seriously short of funds...they hardly have any money now,"" said at least three associates of the group amidst a surprising lull in their activities - suicide bombings and terrorist attacks across Pakistan and parts of Afghanistan - over the past few months."
"In the third quarter of 2018, luxury home prices rose 3.2% year-over-year to reach an average of $1.7 million, according to the latest data from Redfin. Redfin classifies luxury homes as those that sold among the top 5% most expensive in the quarter. According to the company, sales of homes priced at $2 million or more increased for the ninth consecutive quarter. However, this is the smallest growth rate since early 2016. Additionally, the number of homes for sale priced at $2 million or more decreased 6% year-over-year compared to the previous year."

"The General Accounting Office reported last month that the Small Business Administration needs to improve its planning for a new database system. The SBA had planned to implement the Electronic Loan Processing System (ELIPS) which is used to track government-backed small business loans online last week, but the GAO said the agency has not shown that the project is a good investment. The SBA said it did not have time to complete the analysis required by the Clinger-Cohen Act because Congress required the system to be up and running by June 30. The US Army Materiel Command has issued a guide to improve teamwork between agencies and contractors."
"Special Forces of Suriname. Photo by Sanoesie101, Wikipedia Commons. Location of Suriname. Source: CIA World Factbook. In 1980, a group of non-commissioned officers (NCOs) overthrew the elected government despite intense resistance from a poorly armed police force, which only surrendered when the navy forced them into submission. This led to the establishment of a de facto military dictatorship (although there was a nominal civilian president) in the country for the next seven years, headed by Sergeant-Major (self-promoted to Lieutenant Colonel) Desi Delano Bouterse."
"The Lifetime TV channel says it will air a movie about the relationship between Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown. And the network has made sure to hire a veteran actress, who starred alongside the singer in Waiting To Exhale, to direct the biography. Angela Bassett, 55, will make her directorial debut in the TV movie that will focus on the late pop star, who died in 2012. Lifetime announced that the movie will follow Houston and Brown from their first meeting and their tumultuous wedding. It also promises to chronicle the rise to fame of the singer of I Will Always Love You."
"The first time I heard these verses was in a small church in a commercial space in Kiev, Ukraine. I remember it because it was the same Sunday morning that the tragic death of Princess Diana was reported. I had recently left my job on Wall Street and was living in Kiev with my mother after my father had passed away, and I was there because I wasn't having much luck finding my way forward. I remember the wooden panel walls of the room where I sat in the back, slightly embarrassed by the evangelical enthusiasm of my fellow expatriates. But when I heard these verses, my wandering mind refocused again."
"She grew up in a predominantly white and working-class housing development. ""We were the only black people, and I was called racist names on a regular basis,"" she recalls. ""In bed, I would pray and ask to be taught to teach children to be kind to me and to others."" ""This led me to have a 'rainbow of friends' — Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Rastafarians, and Christians. I always wanted to connect with the heart and soul of people, regardless of faith or culture."
"Getty Images photographer John Moore will receive the inaugural Impact Award from the Lucie Awards program on Sunday at Carnegie Hall in New York City. The awards honor great achievements in photography. Moore will join eight other honorees who will be recognized for their work at the gala ceremony. It's not the first award for the photojournalist who grew up in Irving and graduated from the University of Texas at Austin. He won the 2005 Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Photography in 2005, two Overseas Press Club awards, and Pictures of the Year International's Photographer of the Year, among other honors."
"Guess what? The NBA is really a showbiz affair. Only superproducer David Stern isn't manipulating all the strings behind the scenes (otherwise, New York somehow would have won the draft lottery). Instead, the league unfolds like an out-of-control, over-budget Hollywood production — driven by the egos of high-priced players, full of jaw-dropping plot twists, subject to endless rewrites. And think: we haven't even mentioned the Los Angeles Lakers yet. Unfortunately, the biggest news of the season has nothing to do with basketball."
"Doug Newcomb 2015 Lincoln MKC If you want a luxury crossover with elegant design, a lower price, and an alternative to the usual import suspects, the 2015 Lincoln MKC is a compelling option. Relatively affordable. Extensive driver assistance customizations. Quiet ride. Outdated entertainment interface. Less lively engine than rivals. If you want a luxury crossover with elegant design, a lower price, and an alternative to the usual import suspects, the 2015 Lincoln MKC is a compelling option. While Ford has been setting sales records and racking up profits, its luxury division Lincoln has largely been left behind by the competition."
"NASA will submerge a small robot into a volcano in Hawaii in order to map data and geographical features of its interior, such as fissures and volcanic vents. A similar robot is already exploring the volcano. ""We don't exactly know how volcanoes erupt. We have models, but they're all very, very simplified. This project aims to help make those models more realistic,"" said Carolyn Parcheta, a postdoctoral fellow based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, according to NASA. The robot, developed by NASA, can climb areas inaccessible to humans."
"Hearst Magazines will be busy in 2018, completing the acquisition of Rodale, buying some magazines in the Netherlands and increasing the frequency of two of its newest titles. The Pioneer Woman magazine, a joint venture with blogger and Food Network star Ree Drummond, published two sell-out issues in 2017 and will double the frequency to four issues in 2018, according to Hearst Magazines president David Carey, who told employees in his annual year-in-review letter. That's a good change for Airbnb, which attempted on its own in 2014 to launch a magazine called Pineapple, which only lasted one issue."
"A meeting about the future of Kirkcaldy town centre should include debates about disabled access, campaigners have insisted. What should have been a Turkish delight turned into a bittersweet experience for St Johnstone as confusion reigned over their Europa League draw. A Dundee nursery has failed in its bid to increase child places. Dundee inventor John Cruickshank has died at the age of 84. It started as an act of defiance that quickly spread around the world.

"The daughter of a prominent editor of a Kannada tabloid, who was arrested for allegedly hiring a hitman to eliminate his journalist colleague, said today that her father is ""not guilty"" and would come out ""safely"" from the case. Ravi Belagere, who publishes 'Hai Bangalore', was arrested yesterday at his home here on charges of hiring a hitman from Vijayapura in northern Karnataka to kill Sunil Heggaravalli. ""No one has filed a complaint in this case based on a complaint filed by someone. It is a suo motu case by the police based on the statement of Shahi (the hitman)."
"Manatees are large grey aquatic mammals. They have fat bodies, I think ""husky"" is how clothing companies would try to get manatees to buy large pants, that taper into a flat paddle-shaped tail. Average adult manatees measure about 10 feet long and weigh between 800 and 1,200 pounds. Manatees are among God's ugliest creatures in the ocean, and there are plenty of weird-looking sea creatures. Those are facts, well, the observation of ugliness is an opinion, but it's obvious enough to be a fact, that I learned from the Save the Manatee Club website."
"Arcade games are no longer just for kids. Some of the best online casinos on the web now offer arcade games that can be played for real money.

The arcade casino game genre is perfect for the iPhone."
"The Frenchwoman who received the world's first partial face transplant showed off her new features to the public on Monday, saying in a strongly stuttering voice that she now looks like ""everybody else"" and hopes to resume a normal life. Isabelle Dinoire's speech was difficult to understand, but she explained how she had been disfigured by a dog bite last year, and thanked the donor's family for giving her new lips, chin, and nose. A thin circular scar was still visible where the facial tissue was grafted in the 15-hour operation in Amiens on November 27."
"Did Donald Trump release Donald Trump's tax return! For a moment, it seemed like Rachel Maddow had a genuine scoop. And then, suddenly, it wasn't.... Thanks to MSNBC, the suggestion that Trump ""paid no taxes for 18 years"" has now been definitively proven false. Moreover, Trump appears to have paid a higher tax rate in 2005 than most political figures, and to have enjoyed considerable income, to boot. If the report was selectively edited, we can't know in any way."
"MOUNT PLEASANT, Sanpete County — School officials are asking students who are not up to date on immunizations to stay home for several weeks while Sanpete County deals with a mumps outbreak. There are two confirmed cases of mumps in Sanpete County, according to North Sanpete School District Superintendent Dr. Sam Ray. One of them is a district student, he said. Another potential case of mumps is pending as health officials await test results, Ray said. Ray did not say which school the student with mumps attends, but said North Sanpete High School is ""involved"" in the outbreak."
"In times of scarcity, creative bakers turn to desperation pies: The Salt The vinegar pie and the green tomato pie don't usually top the list of America's favorite sweets. But in Depression-era America, these and other desperation pies that survive to this day showed the ingenuity of home cooks. Some desperation pies, like the green tomato pie, still enjoy niche popularity today. Imagine yourself as a resourceful farmer during the Great Depression. You'd like to prepare a dessert for your family, but traditional pie ingredients, like cherries or pecans, are too expensive or unavailable."
"There is a Speed Graphic camera, which once was the standard equipment in newsrooms across the country. You may have seen them in movies from the 1930s and 40s that featured groups of photographers, with ""Press"" badges stuck on the ribbons of their fedora hats. Heavy, bulky, and requiring flash bulbs the size of a light bulb to shoot at night, a Speed Graphic was the first camera I used professionally, for my high school yearbook and the newspaper I worked for part-time while I was in high school and college. The one I have in my office used plate film -- you took a picture, pulled out the film holder, and put in another."
"Anyone who has ever been frustrated with the task of recording video in low light should be ready to be amazed by Canon's strange and amazing new camera. It's a video camera that records high-definition color images in almost complete darkness. The 'multi-purpose' camera, dubbed simply the MH20F-SH, has a full-size image sensor with 2.26 megapixels. The reason for the low resolution is because each pixel is very large, 19 micrometers to be exact. That's 7.5 times larger than, say, the pixels found in a high-end digital SLR camera like the Canon 1Dx."
"Is our efficient Tax Office killing this country? I've never seen a story where the Reserve Bank has urged the government to give tax cuts. But that's exactly what's happening now, which explains in part why our economy is slowing down. In fact, the implication of this historically unusual story is that the Tax Commissioner, Chris Jordan, and his team have been doing a great job cracking down on excessive claims for deductions, especially from businesses. Due to productivity delivered through computer technology, tax collection for the government is booming."
"A facilities manager wears many hats. It's not unusual for a facilities manager to lead a meeting, provide plumbing advice, present a renovation proposal, and ensure the floors are properly cleaned, all in one day. Facilities managers account for the safety and health of all building users, as they consider how a facility operates. Solid training in management, technical skills, construction fundamentals, and technology are needed to be a successful facilities manager. A facilities manager provides oversight for the physical plant of a building or structural campus."
"A communications professor at Texas A&M University wanted to investigate the effects of changes in the newspaper industry on the politics of our nation, so he conducted a study, which has been published in the Journal of Communication. If you've noticed what seems to be a sudden increase in political polarization in recent years, you're not imagining things. And, as Johanna Dunaway, and some colleagues at Colorado State and Louisiana State universities found out, that polarization occurred during a period of constant decline in the number of local newspapers and journalists across the country."
"WASHINGTON -- An Iowa egg producer at the center of a national salmonella outbreak apologized to a Congressional panel on Wednesday and admitted that his family business ""grew much too big before we stopped acting like we were small."" ""What I mean by that is that we were already big before we started adopting sophisticated procedures to make sure we were meeting all the government requirements,"" said egg producer Austin J. DeCoster, in his testimony before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee. He is the founder of an egg empire that has been linked for more than three decades to multiple deadly salmonella poisoning outbreaks in many states."
"A conservative candidate standing in local elections has been suspended from the party after failing to declare a pending drink-driving case in court, where he was later convicted. Ben Wong, 48, owner of the South Dragon House takeaway on Silver Street, put his name forward to stand in the Victoria ward in the May 2 elections under the Conservative party, but has been suspended since his conviction. Nominations to stand in the elections closed on April 3, but he was tried at Taunton Magistrates' Court on March 21, something Somerset Conservatives were unaware of."
"Battfleck is officially history. Ben Affleck is no longer Bruce Wayne in The Batman. And he's passing the torch to a new actor, who has yet to be chosen. Warner Bros. recently announced the official release date of The Batman, with the DC solo adventure scheduled to arrive on June 25, 2021. Shortly after the news was announced, Ben Affleck joined social media to wish director Matt Reeves good luck in taking the masked crusader into the future. The tweet was later confirmed as Ben Affleck's farewell to the character."
"It's customary to leave a tip when dining out, but one gratuity in particular added to an order of a milkshake and fries at a New Jersey diner is infuriating parents. ""My daughter would come to me, telling me that every time she and her friends went to the diner, they would charge them the gratuity,"" said Melissa Desch. ""And when I asked her why, she told me: 'Because they're kids'."" Desch said her daughter Isabella and other students from Colfax Schuyler Middle School frequently go to the Wayne Hills Diner, just across the street from Hamburg Turnpike from the school."
"DALLAS - Like many Americans, Martin Jacobson felt thrilled that Navy SEALs had captured and killed Osama bin Laden. But the Dallas resident felt a deeper connection to the men who hunted down the mastermind behind the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Decades earlier, he was one of them. During World War II, Jacobson was part of elite groups that were predecessors to the SEALs. The secretive force is accustomed to staying out of the spotlight, but has returned to the headlines after the killing of bin Laden. ""I'm just proud of the SEALs,"" said Jacobson, 89."
"Northern Ireland was rated today as the capital of racial hatred in Europe, in a report on racist violence in the province. Human rights advocate Doreen Lawrence, mother of the murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence, was in Belfast for the launch of the report by the Northern Ireland Council for Ethnic Minorities (NICEM). The report identified institutionalized racism in the criminal justice system and questioned how it should be addressed. Racist violence has been growing in Northern Ireland in recent years, not only against blacks and Asians, but almost against anyone considered an outsider."
"About 300 villagers from Kandal province, involved in land disputes with private companies, handed in petitions to embassies in Phnom Penh yesterday, before protesting in front of the provincial hall and asking Prime Minister Hun Sen for help. The villagers told the Post they wanted to put an end to the land disputes caused by companies that had ""grabbed their land"", and added that they would ""rather die"" than return home without getting a result. They said authorities had ignored their pleas for help, while companies had used the judicial system to arrest villagers who complained about the acquisitions."
"The incline press is a strength training exercise to develop the chest and the front parts of the shoulders. The movement is performed in a position with your back up on an exercise bench adjusted at an angle. Then, dumbbells or a barbell are grasped in a hand-over position, and the elbows are extended and bent to raise the weight over the chest. Incline chest press machines that simulate the movement in a fixed plane are another way to perform the movement. The incline press is one of several exercises that help create symmetry and strength in the muscles of the upper body."
"JURGEN KLOPP has revealed his delight at ending Pep Guardiola's 22-game unbeaten run with Manchester City, exclaiming live on air: ""What the hell was that?"". And the Liverpool manager also hit back at critics pointing to his leaky defence, adding: ""Inflate my boots!"". Klopp was on top of the world after masterminding a thrilling 4-3 win over the title favourites at Anfield this morning. A second-half onslaught saw Liverpool take a 4-1 lead before City scored two late goals to set up a nervy finish."
"No one asked me, but... if you pay dues to a neo-Nazi organization, you subscribe to racist publications, buy tickets to a Holocaust denial conference and have a Holocaust denial DVD in your video collection, then you're probably a neo-Nazi. That doesn't mean you're a neo-Nazi forever. You can have a change of heart and a change of mind, and clear your name. If you want people to believe you're no longer a neo-Nazi, you have a lot to prove. It takes a lot of work to take off the brown shirt."
"The first recognition of Brent Moloney's redemption from a post-game drinking binge came mid-season when he was quietly reinstated to the club's leadership group. The second, much more public and significant than the first, came last night when he won Melbourne's best and fairest award. The 27-year-old Moloney took out the Keith 'Bluey' Truscott Trophy ahead of key defenders Jared Rivers and James Frawley at a function at Crown Palladium. Two of Moloney's midfield teammates, Nathan Jones and Jack Trengove, were fourth and fifth respectively."
"The Weeknd will join Daft Punk for a performance at the Grammy Awards. LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Weeknd will join Daft Punk for a performance at the Grammy Awards. The collaboration between the singer and the electronic music duo is one of the numerous pairs announced on Tuesday. Anderson .Paak will take the stage with A Tribe Called Quest and Dave Grohl. Maren Morris is scheduled to perform with Alicia Keys. The Grammys had previously announced that Adele, John Legend, Bruno Mars, Metallica, Carrie Underwood, and Keith Urban would perform."
"DARTMOUTH — On June 14, Flag Day, students at the James M. Quinn Elementary School in Dartmouth gathered outside to celebrate Flag Day. In itself, this is not unusual, but this year it took on a more personal meaning. The reason is that Dr. Carol Karafotis' cousin, Ted Cote, from New Bedford, is serving in Iraq. At the beginning of the year, around Veterans Day, Dr. Karafotis asked her students to send cards to Sergeant Ted Cote to cheer him up. The students responded and made cards that were then sent to Iraq."
"Will UBS name Bob McCann or Sallie Krawcheck to the top wealth management job? The former brokerage chief of Merrill Lynch, Bob McCann, and the former wealth management chief of Citigroup, Sallie Krawcheck, are both being considered to take the top job at UBS's wealth management unit. Investment News reported that two industry recruiters say both names ""are already circulating."" Previously, the Financial Times had reported that UBS's new chief executive, Oswald Grubel, had decided not to sell the company's US wealth management business, despite speculation over the past few months that he might get rid of the business following tax evasion allegations and the subsequent scandal."
"If the U.S. presidential election were to be decided on social media, Barack Obama would be the clear winner this year over Republican challenger Mitt Romney. The Obama campaign has embraced social media, with the president maintaining a huge lead in Facebook and Twitter followers, and the affiliated Democratic National Committee is using private social media tools to communicate with some campaign operatives. There is also evidence that the Obama campaign has leveraged social media analytics to gauge voter sentiment and track the popularity of campaign messages. Neither of the campaigns, contacted to discuss their social media strategies, returned messages."
"Should we take a pause for just a moment to define impact investing? Great! Now that they're gone, we can talk business. For over four years, I've been covering impact investing as a regular contributor to Forbes and I've written hundreds of articles on the topic. The thing is: most impact investments are only open to wealthy individuals. This is a guide to impact investing for everyone else, the 98 percent of the population who don't meet the criteria to invest with the rich."
"Health authorities have issued another warning about measles after a person traveled on public transport and visited two universities and a grocery store while infected. The alert is the fourth of its kind in recent weeks. The most recently infected person visited a series of public spaces between Sunday, January 27, and Wednesday, January 30. On January 30: by train from Aubin Grove to Perth between 10:25 and 11:15 am, and from Canning Bridge to Mandurah between 2:20 and 3:15 pm.

"Wait for sun today as high pressure sets in this weekend. After a cold start, temperatures will warm up to the upper 40s and lower 50s. A chilly night ahead under mostly clear skies. Lows in the upper 20s and lower 30s. Winds will be out of the south tomorrow, meaning we'll see some milder temperatures. Expect highs in the upper 50s. Some communities could reach the 60s. More clouds will build in though as the day wears on. It looks like clouds will clear out during the night with lows in the upper 30s and lower 40s."
"It looked like the scene after an earthquake. A sea of orange boxes covered the floors, shoes packed into every crevice, as bewildered people stood in shock. But this was no natural disaster. This was Black Friday at a Nike factory store in Seattle. Horrified shoppers at the Seattle Premium Outlets in Tulalip, Washington, shared photos and videos of the deplorable condition of the store after the holiday weekend. They show people carelessly trampling the boxes that protect the Nike shoes as they walk through the outlet, grabbing and discarding sneakers mindlessly as they make their way."
"The 27th annual southwest Iowa hot air balloon festival is underway this weekend in Creston. Balloon committee spokesperson Bill Fastenow says winds are the determining factor in whether the balloons will fly or not and, of course, their destination. Fastenow says this (Saturday) afternoon at 4:30, there will be a balloon pilots meeting, followed by a ""night glow"" at the Creston airport south of town, which he says is a nice sight to see. Creston Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Ellen Gerharz says at least 57 balloon pilots have signed up to participate in this weekend's events."
"CNET reporters are covering the launch of the highly publicized iPhone 4. Stay tuned for updates from New York City and San Francisco. It's finally here. The highly anticipated iPhone 4 will hit store shelves on Thursday at 7 a.m. local time in each time zone where it is available. CNET has teams of reporters covering the launch in New York City and San Francisco. Marguerite Reardon and Caroline McCarthy will be leading the coverage in New York, while Erica Ogg, Josh Lowensohn, and James Martin will be keeping an eye on what's happening out west."
"The unemployment rate in Stark County in August fell to 6.8 percent, the lowest level since September 2008. For the first time since 2008, Stark County's unemployment rate dipped below 7 percent, and a variety of factors likely contributed to the decline. A prime suspect is the influx of businesses coming to the area due to oil and natural gas drilling in the Utica Shale formation. Oil exploration companies have set up shop, followed by engineering and construction companies providing various services. Manufacturing has also experienced growth due to increased local and national demand for steel and drilling equipment."
"A horror movie icon will visit one of Gaston County's haunted attractions on Wednesday and Thursday. Actor Derek Mears, who has appeared in ""Friday the 13th (2009)"", ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"", ""Predators"", and ""Men in Black II"", will greet horror seekers at The Haunted Mill in Belmont. Kevin Blanchfield, owner of the mill, said he tries to offer something new and exciting each year at the attraction. He hopes the appearance of ""Friday the 13th"" character Jason Voorhees will boost attendance during the weeknights. The mill usually sees around 200 to 300 people on weeknights near Halloween."
"WASHINGTON (News Alliance) - The price of gold remained stable on Thursday after the latest Fed report on the economy said that businesses across the US have become less optimistic in recent months. Spot gold rose 0.2% to $1,294.11 per ounce, while US gold futures remained virtually unchanged at $1,293.75 per ounce. As economic obstacles increase, the Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates stable at least until June. The dollar took a breather today after recent gains, while the pound sterling stabilized after British Prime Minister Theresa May won a confidence vote in parliament and urged lawmakers to break the deadlock in a Brexit divorce agreement."
"President Jacob Zuma believes that the public protector's report on state capture was a political tool meant to be used to deal with certain individuals. In an exclusive interview with ANN7 on Monday night, Zuma spoke about the state capture report by former public protector Thuli Madonsela, in which she recommended that Zuma establish a commission of inquiry into state capture and that Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng choose the judge to preside over it. The report investigated whether Zuma's friends, the controversial Gupta family, had undue influence over the executive."
"Why we love it: few things are as elegant as a good night's sleep. After all, a night of rest can leave you with a fresh appearance and a feeling of refreshment in the morning. Perhaps one of the most important factors that contributes to capturing quality Zs is a good mattress. The new mattress, which is available in sizes ranging from single to California king, is made with five layers of ""premium"" foam, including a one-inch ""flo"" foam, 1.5 inches of latex foam, 1.5 inches of viscoelastic memory foam, 1.5 inches of high-resilience foam with gel support pads and more."
"Jenna Barker of Seton Catholic set a sectional record by winning the 1,600-meter run in 5 minutes, 13.04 seconds, and also won the 800, as several area athletes qualified for regional during the IHSAA girls' track sectional on Tuesday at Connersville High School. Other individual sectional champions included Riley Austin of Richmond in the 200 and long jump, Nakala Bennett of Richmond in the 100, Hanna Stamm of Seton Catholic in the 3,200, and Austin, Lindsey Griffin, Payton Vanmiddlesworth, and Riley Wetzel of Richmond in the 400 relay."
"When the theme of the convention seemed to have been ""Drill, baby, drill"", which is an energy policy in the same way that ""Tax, baby, tax"" is a fiscal policy (i.e., it's not), the slogans are obviously all that's left to the party. Even if you think increasing oil exploration and supply through more offshore drilling makes sense, you can't take these people seriously. Unfortunately, you can. This, by the way, was the moment when I completely gave up on the convention."
"The new chairman of the board of the National Children's Hospital has said it would be ""a bad deal"" for the State to allow the hospital's main builder to step down from its role. The newly appointed chairman of the board, Fred Barry, who is appearing before the Oireachtas Health Committee this morning, also said there was an ""underestimation"" from a very early stage in relation to what the project would cost, which led to a hike in the bill to €1.73 billion, from the estimated cost of €800 million in 2014."
"Bob Cannard shovels compost that originally came from San Francisco food scraps at Green String Farms on the outskirts of Petaluma, Calif., Friday, March 6, 2009. As a parent and someone who has worked with parents for many years, I was struck by the front-page report on the heartbreaking death of an infant in El Cerrito (""Baby's death in car a tragic lesson for all parents,"" June 10). The premise that parents can ""easily forget that their children are in the back seat"" is, sadly, all too true."
"Summary: Southeast Toyota Distributors, LLC (SET) is recalling certain 2016 model year Toyota Yaris, Rav4, Land Cruiser and 4Runner vehicles, and Scion FR-S, iM and TC vehicles manufactured from January 28, 2016 to March 14, 2016. The load carrying capacity modification label may not reflect the correct added weight of the installed accessories. As a result, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard number 110, ""Tire Selection and Rims for Passenger Cars."" Consequence: An incorrect label may result in the vehicle being overloaded, increasing the risk of a crash."
"An American Civil Liberties Union lawyer today asked a federal appeals court in San Francisco to block a California law that requires police to collect a DNA sample from anyone arrested on suspicion of a serious crime. The law is part of a 2004 voter initiative that gradually expanded the categories of people in the criminal justice system from whom DNA is collected with cheek swabs. The four plaintiffs are challenging a provision that took effect in 2009 and requires DNA sampling of all those arrested for serious crimes, regardless of whether they are charged with or convicted of a crime."
"Really? Was it that complex? The Green Bay Press-Gazette reports that authorities say they are two to three weeks away from completing an investigation into an alleged sexual assault involving Packers cornerback Brandon Underwood. Underwood has been accused by two Milwaukee women of assaulting them in Lake Delton, Wis., a resort area, after a charity event. The alleged incident occurred on June 5 and days after the incident, police officials said they doubted any charges could be filed as a result of the incident. One of the major hurdles! The stories told by the women allegedly changed, initially implicating several Packers and then only Underwood."
"A new logo to help identify how the community feels about the Seminole County school system will soon be developed, using at least one of the four winning entries in the County Logo Contest. School board members said they wanted a new logo because the system's current emblem, that of a school crossing sign, does not reflect the district's academic achievements. The competition was divided into four age groups: 10 years or younger as the elementary group, 11 to 14 years in the junior group, 15 to 18 years in the senior group, and 19 years or older in the adult group."
"LOS ANGELES (AP) - Kings forward Anze Kopitar will undergo surgery on Wednesday to repair the broken ligaments in his severely sprained right ankle. A magnetic resonance imaging exam on Monday confirmed that the Kings' top scorer will require corrective surgery that will keep him out of the game indefinitely. Kopitar injured his ankle when he fell awkwardly during the Kings' victory over Colorado last Saturday. Coach Terry Murray initially said that the Slovenian All-Star had broken his ankle and would be out for at least six weeks, but the Kings eventually determined that the injury was a high ankle sprain. Kopitar leads the Kings with 25 goals and 43 assists."
"Two people have been injured in a crash on State Highway 2 near Whakamaramara. What was initially reported as a three-car crash yesterday, police now believe were two separate crashes in almost the same spot near Apata Station Rd. A St John ambulance spokesperson said two people were transported from the scene to Tauranga Hospital - one in a serious condition and one in a moderate condition. Police were first called to the area around 1:10 pm. ""Two crashes occurred in a short space of time in the same location. It appears a utility vehicle went off the road, and after that a collision occurred between a car and a truck."
"Richard Randolph Lamb, a resident of Dunsmuir, passed away on September 17, 2009, at Mercy Medical Center in Mount Shasta. Richard was born in Fairview, Montana. He moved to Siskiyou County from Oregon in 1919. Richard was a veteran of the United States Navy, serving in the Pacific Fleet during World War II. He worked as a railroad engineer for the Southern Pacific Railroad for 34 years. Richard was a member of the Dunsmuir Veterans of Foreign Wars. His hobbies included bowling, cars, music, traveling, and love for his family."
"The Korea Shipbuilding and Offshore Association has released numbers that confirm the expectations of many analysts: the number of shipyards in active operation around the world has decreased by more than 40 percent compared to what it was seven years ago. The study defined an active shipyard as a facility with at least one ship on its order book. Active Chinese shipyards decreased from 380 to 140 and Japanese shipyards went from 70 to 60 in the same period, according to the association. Even worse, the world's largest shipyards – DSME, Hyundai Heavy, and Samsung Heavy – may have empty space and unused capacity at some point next year."
"""Interaction of Color"", the 1963 landmark book by Josef Albers — the German-born artist and educator who taught at the Bauhaus, Black Mountain College, and Yale University throughout his accomplished career — is not just for aspiring artists. Its hypnotic illustrations are a revelation for anyone interested in color theory and human perception. On Thursday, to commemorate the book's 50th anniversary, Yale University Press, the publisher of the original edition, will offer a new way to interact with Albers' lessons by launching the ""Interaction of Color"" app for iPad."
"MELBOURNE, Australia - Defending champion Victoria Azarenka struggled to contain injured American Jamie Hampton 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 on Saturday before advancing to the fourth round of the Australian Open. Hampton, who required a medical timeout for a lower back problem before serving in the second set and twisted in pain, frequently on the verge of tears, throughout the third, still managed to hit 41 winners to keep top-ranked Azarenka under pressure. Azarenka appeared frustrated at times, but overcame an early break and defended a triple break point in the seventh game of the deciding set before winning the match in 2 hours, 9 minutes."
"Suzuki discovered improper testing in 6,401 units out of a total of 12,819 since 2012. In a major blow to the Japanese automaker, Suzuki Motor announced that the company used improper fuel economy and emissions testing in its vehicles in Japan. According to Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport, Suzuki, along with Mazda and Toyota, admitted to cheating on emissions tests and submitted a report of sampled vehicles manufactured during the quality assurance process. Additionally, it was found that the samples had been subjected to testing under improper driving conditions. However, the company is not considering a product recall at this time."
"Brands should resist the temptation to tackle a controversial topic in the Super Bowl as a way to stand out, said Aimee Drolet, professor of marketing and behavioral decision-making at the University of California, Los Angeles' Anderson School of Management. ""It's generally not the best place to do it because the audience is so broad, so you're inevitably going to upset half the people,"" she said. In other matters, U.C. officials announced that the 10-campus system had set a new fundraising record in 2017-18, raising more than $2.7 billion."
"Margaret O'Brien, 69, moved from Canada to Wolverhampton in 1971, married, had three children, and worked for the local council for over 25 years as a canteen worker, meals on wheels driver, lollipop lady, and cleaner. A back injury a few years ago meant she had to leave her job, which led her to claim benefits for the first time. In 2015, she was told her disability payments had been suspended because she was an illegal immigrant. The letter informed her ""of our intention to remove you from the UK to your country of nationality if you do not leave voluntarily""."
"Let's translate that for you: 

Let's stop trying to put a label on it and just be happy. Alright, I'm going to say this so everyone stops speculating about whether Taylor Swift and Calvin Harris are a couple: they're just dating. You must have heard Taylor's song from 1989 ""I Know Places"". It's a song about developing a relationship while the paparazzi chase them everywhere. ""Something happens when everyone finds out / Seeing vultures circling, dark clouds / Love is a fragile little flame that can be extinguished"", she sings. Just hang in there, HarriSwift."
"PARIS (Reuters) - Longchamp, one of France's leading handbag manufacturers, plans to increase its presence in China, according to its CEO, in marked contrast to the reduction of its rivals and despite the economic slowdown and changing consumer culture there. Many of the leading luxury brands, such as Kering's (PRTP.PA) Gucci and LVMH's (LVMH.PA) Louis Vuitton, have slowed down new store openings in China as part of campaigns to preserve their exclusive image. ""We are far from having fully exploited China,"" said Jean Cassegrain, CEO of the privately-owned group, in an interview with Reuters."
"The annual meeting of Kelly's band is normally a festive affair. The meeting, an idea of New York Post media columnist Keith J. Kelly, has been held on St. Patrick's Day for the past three years at Langan's pub on 47th Street. The guests: media types and others celebrating their shared Kelly surname and innate Irishness, over corned beef and cabbage and a couple of pints of Guinness. But the mood changed when Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly arrived. Wearing a green tie, he tried to keep things light: ""Kellys are fun people,"" he declared."
"NEW YORK — Just before noon on Wednesday, Australian Ambassador and President of the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty conference, Peter Woolcott, released his final version of the global arms control agreement. In releasing the document, Woolcott informed delegates they have 24 hours to consult with their respective governments and then present themselves the next day for a final vote. For many reasons, the United States delegation must choose the latter option. Provided below are some sections of the proposed agreement, each of which would require the federal government to unconstitutionally infringe upon the right of Americans to keep and bear arms, as protected by the Second Amendment."
"The sixth race of the Charlevoix Yacht Club summer series was sailed on August 8 in light and variable winds. Twenty-two boats finished the race, which consisted of a shortened course of six windward and leeward legs. Affinity was the fastest boat overall, and only 26 seconds of corrected time separated the top three boats in the Spinnaker A fleet this week. Two more races and one more drop will determine the summer series totals. The race results were provided by Mike Miller and Keith Attee, committee chairs. Jib and Main Fleet: 1 - Sonnett (Lepmann); 2 - Exitus (Pung)."
"A search for 'toxic mold' will yield hundreds of warnings and frightening 'studies', but few are based on science, and many are motivated by profit. Recently, one of my patients was hospitalized for liver failure due to alcohol. His history of liver disease was well-documented, but he vehemently denied that anyone had ever warned him that he should avoid alcohol. An initial admission of ""a few drinks"" turned into much more with a little investigation by different medical providers. Although his liver was in a state of significant shock, he was stable and fortunate enough to still have most of his liver function intact."
"It's easy to lose democratic mechanisms but difficult to recover them, says the incoming secretary general of the Lutheran World Federation. Speaking at St Paul's Cathedral in London, Bishop Katharine Jefferts Schori challenged Christians to take action against the world's injustices. The Catholic Church in Scotland is being questioned over plans to charge parishioners the cost of going to see the Pope on his visit to Glasgow. “Eleanor's zucchini has grown so much this past week, and she's checking on it all the time”."

Anna Cedeno, a recent cancer survivor, was walking to a bus stop when she was hit by a passing BMW, reports the New York Post. She died two hours later. Police did not issue a citation to the driver, noting that Cedeno was not crossing at a crosswalk or traffic signal. They only went against their stance because they were criticized for it.

"Without much fanfare or fuss, but, fortunately, with many buyers, Salisbury quietly reopened its central shopping center on Saturday, almost three months after it became the scene of an international incident. The Maltings, which connects the bus parking lot with the city center, had been closed to the public and protected by cordons and security tents since former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found collapsed on one of its park benches after being poisoned. Market traders were relocated behind the shopping precinct by Wiltshire County Council while the decontamination operation was carried out."
"It may not be the household name that devices like Roku, Chromecast or Fire TV are, but Nvidia's Shield TV remains a capable streaming media player, so much so that it earned a spot on our list of the best streaming players you can buy. However, if you have one, you may feel jealous seeing the support for Amazon's Alexa voice assistant popping up on other devices left and right. Don't worry, though, as Nvidia has announced that its Android-based streaming box will also be receiving support for Alexa control."
"Dundee United will begin talks in the coming days in an attempt to prevent Scottish striker Steven Thompson from leaving the club for free in the summer. Tannadice's new owner, Eddie Thompson, is angry that recently sacked manager Alex Smith and the previous board had not already moved to secure a new contract for the 23-year-old player.

He will be able to start talking to potential new clubs in January."
"The search for properties reveals nothing about the community experience or stellar service. Mobile is now the preferred mode of interaction with the online world, regardless of the goal or content. Video is simply no longer an option, use it for an authentic presentation or risk being forgotten. I have a confession to make: I don't attend Inman Connect to connect. At least, not in the way most people understand it. As a marketing director for an industry provider, my daily job is to educate real estate agents. However, when I come to Inman Connect, I can learn from the agents."

"By arresting Haniyeh, Israel sent a message that the smuggling of Palestinian money is coming to an end. It is an open secret that Hamas has been bringing in millions of dollars into Gaza through the Rafah crossing since the international community cut off financial aid to the Palestinian Authority a few months ago, after Hamas' rise to power. However, the decision of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on Thursday to close the Rafah crossing to prevent Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh from bringing in $35 million into Gaza was the first time Israel actively intervened to stop the flow of money."

"""Fox & Friends"" convenes an all-male panel to judge whether women are ""covering their feminine parts"". 
On Tuesday morning's ""Fox & Friends"", a panel of men was convened to determine the ""proper etiquette for wearing leggings"", and they did it in the most elegant way possible: by parading young women in leggings in front of them so they could criticize their appearance.

""I have to confess, at the time I was pretty angry,"" he said about the strong backlash from the White House and the people of the Gulf of Mexico. ""I hadn't seen my son in three months."
"It's safe to say that Cleveland Browns cornerback and former ASU student Damarious Randall didn't expect a response like this. After the Warriors advanced to the NBA Finals on Monday night to set up a rematch with the Cleveland Cavaliers, Randall made a guarantee on Twitter: ""If the Cleveland Cavaliers win the 2018 NBA finals I'll buy everyone who retweet's this a jersey..."" 
Well, as of Wednesday afternoon, Randall's tweet has been retweeted over 800,000 times. That's a lot of jerseys, more than Randall could probably afford to give away."
"Elvira Alonzo sees recycling as essential for the future. The public works director of McAllen oversees the city's recycling program and ensures its operations run smoothly. Plastic, cardboard, glass, and other common materials are moved, pulverized, or transferred for reuse in a compound on North Bentsen Road. The operation presents a cost-effectiveness and a facilitation of services towards the public good. Clean streets, quality drainage systems, and maintaining the mission of Keep McAllen Beautiful are some of the services of working in this sector, said Alonzo. Low-quality products harm the community, and her work turns negatives into positives."

"The lead seal is the first one found with the image of Saint Sabas, an important local figure 1,500 years ago. A rare seal from the time of the Crusades has been found in the Kiryat Yovel neighborhood in Jerusalem. The lead seal, which dates back about 800 years, bears the likeness of Saint Sabas, one of the most important people active in Jerusalem during the Byzantine period, about 1,500 years ago. Despite the importance of Saint Sabas — whose Syriac name is Mar Saba — to Christian history in Israel, no seals with his image had been found before."
"When I went to meet Bono at the bar of his hotel, I saw Richard Gere sitting at a table with a beautiful woman in a small fur coat and a leather cap. Bono, on the other hand, had retired to a quiet room in the back, where he was keeping company with a stout middle-aged white man in a suit and tie.

"Dundee has long been a city of rich character, great wealth and extreme poverty. If the new V&A can give it a transformative boost, it will be worth every penny. I declare an interest. I attended the embryonic University of Dundee in its last year as a St Andrews college and, like many to whom life in the city has been allotted, I have retained a great affection for the place and the people. Not everyone grew up to love it. In those days, ""clearing"" sent hordes of last-minute placements to what they fondly anticipated as the cloistered life of Queen's College, St Andrews."

"The Planning Commission approved a sidewalk extension along a portion of the Laguna Canyon frontage road despite opposition from some commissioners and residents during its Wednesday night meeting in the City Council chambers. The commission voted 3 to 2 to remove an existing sidewalk, swale, and four trees, and install a new sidewalk, swale, pedestrian access ramp, and curb from Woodland Street south along the Laguna Canyon frontage road to connect with an existing sidewalk. The sidewalk would reduce the existing roadway by about 2 and a half feet, to 15 and a half feet once completed. The Boys and Girls Club and the Sawdust Art Festival are located along the road."

The defensive look is expected to change with Steve Spagnuolo taking over as defensive coordinator instead of Bob Sutton, but pass rushers are always highly valued and General Manager Brett Veach didn't seem to be preparing to say goodbye to Ford."

It also shows that only 1 in 200 people surveyed believe that newspapers will be a dominant source of information in 2014.

This month, the World Wide Web turned 20, and its birthday was celebrated around the world. It was a pleasant change from when the medium, which was once a new frontier of hope, had been viewed with suspicion since the Cambridge Analytica scandal occurred. We had spent years being outraged by the possibility that our choice of washing machines and underwear was being conditioned by the intelligent web advertising, and in 2018, we learned that even the choice of voters was open to manipulation."
"The crowd's response to the bombs at the finish line was, I think, exemplary. Of course, many people ran away from the explosions, and rightly so. But a notable number ran, as they say, towards the sound of the guns, despite the fact that when two bombs explode, one might expect more. Many of these were professionals. The finish line of a marathon is a fortunate place to put a bomb, as it is where medical personnel, police, ambulances, and so on are stationed. Some soldiers happened to be in the area. But others were not professionals."

This is according to researchers at 24/7 Wall Street, who created an index using the proportion of potentially hazardous bridges, roads, or dams to identify the states with the worst infrastructure of all."
"Sanford already has private attorneys. Garber said he was hired to protect the institution of the governor's office and to help lawmakers realize the gravity of their deliberations. ""The eyes of the world are on South Carolina,"" Garber said on Tuesday, adding that lawmakers' decision on whether to impeach Sanford will have ramifications for future governors of South Carolina and for the state. Garber said Sanford's disappearance for five days in June to secretly visit his lover in Argentina does not meet the high standard required for impeachment. The state Constitution states that serious crimes or other serious acts of misconduct are the only reasons for impeachment."

"The most likely source stood out for the Boston Red Sox on Sunday. David Ortiz, who has never backed down from a big moment, hit a three-run homer against Joba Chamberlain in the ninth inning to give the Red Sox a 5-3 win over the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park. The win ended Boston's five-game losing streak and stopped the club's streak of seven consecutive series sweeps. Ortiz's heroics obviously put the Red Sox on top. But there was much more to Sunday's win, so let's look at some notes from the nationally televised meeting."

Companies can withhold some of the names under a law that protects trade secrets. The groups say that loophole should be closed. (Dillon) Last year, doctors and other healthcare providers in Vermont received around $3.1 million in gifts from pharmaceutical companies.

"Everyone knows where and what they were doing when this nightmare called 9/11 occurred. Chuck was getting ready to go to work and I was on the computer watching FOX when those horrible images appeared. I had the TV on mute, so I only saw flames coming out of one of the Towers in New York. I turned on the sound and the words were incomprehensible. For some reason, even before knowing why and what, tears had started welling up in my eyes. It's funny how your gut instincts take over before your mind even registers what's happening."

"While the gigantic and spectacular circus shows tour the Earth, it is good to remember how they evolved from what was essentially street theater. This Colombian acrobatic troupe, a dozen young performers presenting the world premiere of their latest show, is one of the main attractions of the Blackpool Showzam Festival, now firmly established in February, featuring performances from all over the world. Circolombia heads to London after five days of performances here, but nothing will be able to match the thrill of seeing them in the rococo setting of the circus ring that sits between the legs of Blackpool Tower."

"DENVER -- During the summer of 2002, Colorado state officials were dealing with the 138,000-acre Hayman fire while trying to get the word out to potential tourists that the state was still open for business. That comment virtually short-circuited the state's summer vacation season.

When Owens made his comments, Colorado had 24 million visitors who spent around $7 billion annually. Denver had 10 million visitors who spent around $2.3 billion.

"When George Orwell wrote ""1984"" he included a vision of the future in which people would converse in a language called Newspeak. Orwell described Newspeak as ""the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year"". Orwell's idea with Newspeak was to have a world where all nuances of meaning were eliminated from language, which reinforced the State's total dominance. Calling something by a name when it is exactly the opposite could also be an example of Orwellian Newspeak, such as calling a bill full of spending on liberal social programs an economic stimulus plan."

But before the Argentinazo, most middle-class Argentines considered such actions to be macabre rituals of a bygone era."

Baltimore, similar to Palestine, is under racist military occupation. The Baltimore police force — the sixth largest in the 26th largest U.S. city — treats Black people like prisoners. According to the 2010 U.S. census, while 72 percent of Baltimore's population are people of color, 46 percent of the police force are white."

"A study suggests that complex behaviors were transmitted over tens of thousands of years. Despite intense scientific research, there are still large gaps in our knowledge about primitive human life. One of the main questions that remains unanswered is: when were humans first capable of complex cognition? In other words, when did primitive humans develop sophisticated cognitive abilities, such as prioritization and cultural transmission, that we would recognize today? A new study in Nature addresses this; after six years of excavation, archaeologists have discovered technologically advanced stone tools that were created around 71,000 years ago."

And don't even try traditional advertising with them, better stick to social media. If all of this sounds familiar, it's because it's a small glimpse into the countless contradictory reports about millennials."

"For a world that watches, the vision of Great Britain in flames this week has surely been striking. The looting and fires have revealed a London, Birmingham, and Manchester inner city that is rarely glimpsed in the England that is normally offered for export through soft-focus period dramas, Hugh Grant movies, or stories about Will and Kate. If the revelation has bewildered foreigners, it has confused Britons no less. The mood here is a mix of anger, fear, and perplexity. It's not that we're unaccustomed to riots: we are. England burned during that other royal wedding year, 1981."

"New research suggests that mice with Alzheimer's-like symptoms had improved cognitive function when given a synthetic hormone similar to estrogen. ""This synthetic hormone improved behavior in a manner similar to that of estrogen,"" said study leader Dr. Christian Pike, associate professor at the University of Southern California's Davis School of Gerontology. But unlike estrogen, which builds up the uterus and is a known risk factor for endometrial and breast cancer, PPT did not cause obvious changes in the animals' reproductive tract. ""This could be a promising strategy to maximize the benefits of hormone therapy while minimizing its risk,"" Pike said."

"Forget announcing your latest album with a massive and over-the-top outdoor concert, Oasis has been hiring street musicians to do the heavy promotional work for them. A group of street musicians and street performers were gathered on Friday to perform new Oasis songs at various locations around Manhattan. The uneven group included violinists, guitarists, and – we can only hope – some of those human statues covered in gold spray paint. From subway platforms to park clearings, they played across the five boroughs – even in the torrential rain. Thoth and Dominic Del Principe were among those who got soaked."
"In her weekly therapy sessions, Julie revealed her most uncomfortable secrets: depression, debt, childhood sexual abuse. Her psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital would then type a summary into Julie's computerized medical record. With that, more than 200 pages of sensitive notes became available to any doctor who treated her within the vast Partners HealthCare system. She only found out about this when a doctor later referred to the notes. Julie, a 43-year-old lawyer, felt uncomfortable, then angry. ""The details are really nobody's business,"" she said. But Partners disagrees."
"To engage the private sector in healthcare, what is actually required is a significant increase in investment in the public sector to reach more people. The nation has a new health policy after 14 years. The long interval itself indicates the priority, or the lack of it, accorded to a sector that needs some urgent attention and has deep connections with the nation's aspiration to grow faster and become a strong economy in the world order. The new policy has proposed seven key changes in the organization of healthcare services, including a welcome change from selective primary care to comprehensive assured care with links to referral hospitals."
"The head of Vodafone Hutchison Australia (VHA), Iñaki Berroeta, has attempted to moderate expectations about the imminent boom of 5G networks in Australia, saying that although his company is moving forward, he does not anticipate consumer devices to be on the market until at least late 2019. Berroeta refused to discuss any spectrum ambitions for Australian 5G, instead emphasizing that the new ""ecosystem"" for mobile technology must be in place before operators begin promoting products.

"I've just been reminded of why I abandoned financial journalism after 11 years in the post, including a stint as a correspondent on Wall Street. While the world of finance had its fascinations, I became increasingly disillusioned with the dominant narrative that it was always about the money, rather than other considerations such as values and social impacts, which never registered on the radar. It's not entirely surprising, given the testosterone-driven trading floors and the fact that there's very little connection between the decisions made by city executives and their impact on the lives of ordinary people."

"Syria: Why is Assad advancing? In the presidential elections held in early June, Assad was declared the winner with 88.7% of the votes. This is not surprising considering the nature of the regime. However, despite the fact that these elections were not ""free"" at all, and that many people were unable to vote because they were in refugee camps beyond the country's borders, what emerged was that a significant section of the population is supporting Assad. Why is that? Stop the criminal attack on Gaza! Yesterday, the Israeli army launched a ground offensive in Gaza."

"BlackBerry has decided not to renew T-Mobile's license to sell its products. A promotion that went wrong last month has led BlackBerry to cut ties with T-Mobile after numerous years of working together. BlackBerry announced on Wednesday that it will not renew T-Mobile's license to sell its products when it expires on April 25.

"November 17, 2015 12:55 a.m.
Michael Hoeppner had to leave behind his Manhattan street manners. We realized we were paying a premium in Manhattan. We looked everywhere. We got into this area, and the houses are impressive, and it just seemed nicer. The people who sold us this house live next door, Rodney and Desmond. They already had a couple of offers. I think part of what happened is that they wanted us to be their neighbors: a pregnant couple trying to buy their first home. I'm sure that probably was more attractive than an extra 0.1 percent on the down payment or whatever."

He co-founded Imperva, which went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2011, and co-founded Trusteer, which was sold to IBM for $1 billion in 2013. Shortly after this acquisition, he founded Transmit Security. Curiously, Boodaei did so without seeking venture capital.

"WASHINGTON — South Florida has long been a laboratory for some of the nation's toughest policies, with techniques such as ghost candidates created by political rivals to divert votes from their opponents, or so-called ballot brokers hired to illegally fill stacks of absentee ballots on behalf of elderly or disabled voters.

"Hull - Where the U.S. goes, the U.K. often follows. This is especially true in the case of negative things. If the U.S. has extreme weather, we generally experience something similar a few days later. If violent crime increases on the other side of the pond, the same happens in the U.K. Then there's the shopping craze. The U.K. is adopting traditional U.S. activities such as Christmas shopping sales that leave customers with empty wallets and a variety of unwanted products. Black Friday has just passed and today is Cyber Monday. Each has become a major shopping day on both sides of the pond."

""The polls are open, come on in!"""
"As a veteran of the movement to combat climate change, I've been conditioned to expect disappointment. So when, as administrative coordinator for Fossil Free Stanford, I was called into the office of the senior assistant to the president of Stanford University in early May, I approached the meeting with trepidation. There were good reasons for my concern. That same morning, Harvard had arrested a student who was demanding an open dialogue about fossil fuel divestment. Last fall, Brown University had flatly refused students' calls to cut ties with thirteen of the most polluting coal companies. Efforts to implement climate policies at the national and international level had fared no better."

"The carrier operates 744 mainline aircraft that vary in size, carrying from 50 to 366 passengers each. For a typical 737 aircraft that carries 179 passengers, the reduction would mean about 11 pounds per flight. According to the article, stopping the sale of duty-free items on board such as ""perfumes, chocolates, and liquor"" also saved 1.4 million gallons of fuel annually, saving United Airlines $2.3 million. Presumably, that also means United was making less than $2.3 million selling the items on board or figured letting passengers pick them up on the ground would not significantly affect their revenue."
"According to the data provided in the Global Enabling Trade Report 2012 by the World Economic Forum, the country's macroeconomic fundamentals are strong, making it attractive to at least a fraction of foreign investors concerned about the euro crisis. The country's greatest investment opportunities are in manufacturing, the real estate sector, agriculture, mining, infrastructure, retail trade, and tourism, areas of investment that are largely untapped given the volume of foreign direct investment seeking attractive international opportunities. Manufacturing is especially attractive to Japanese and Korean companies. Retail trade is booming, due to the increase in domestic consumption."

"It's Tax Day: Remember the Krewe of Procrastinators on Loyola Avenue! Every so often, we come across a photo in The Times-Picayune archives that is so striking it prompts us a simple question: ""What's going on in this photograph of New Orleans in the name of Momus Alexander Morgus?"" When we do, we've decided to share it and try to answer that question. Photographer: Erby Aucoin, The Times-Picayune archive. What it's not: Nothing as fun as those smiles might suggest."
"US government debt yields rose on Friday after the US government said job creation was stronger than expected in March, but wages grew at a slow pace. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.538%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 2.947%. Bond yields move inversely to prices. Job creation surged in March after a lackluster February, with an expansion of 196,000 nonfarm payroll jobs, according to a Labor Department report released on Friday. The unemployment rate remained steady at 3.8%, meeting expectations."
"The Duchess of Sussex's maternity wardrobe may come with a royal price tag, but yours doesn't have to. The Meghan Markle effect is in full swing, or should we say, full term. Since the Duchess of Sussex, who is due to give birth to her first child sometime next month, announced her pregnancy last fall, fashion enthusiasts have been watching her every public move, eager to see what she's wearing and how she's wearing it. Such scrutiny is nothing new for Markle, whose style has become iconic since she stepped onto the royal scene."
"Trisha Pollard believes Texas' social services system relies too much on courts to enforce the law against Medicaid fraud and not enough on a tool that was put in their hands almost nine years ago: background checks. ""It seems like such a simple thing,"" Pollard said on Tuesday. ""People in other areas of life are routinely subjected to background checks."" The 52-year-old retired attorney encountered this issue last fall when she served as the chair of a Harris County grand jury. During her tenure, Pollard and her fellow grand jurors returned indictments against two Medicaid providers, each of whom had a criminal history that included involvement in Medicaid fraud."
"Jennifer Garner was spotted out and about with her son, Samuel. Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck have yet to release photos of their three-month-old son Samuel, but this afternoon, Jen stepped out in Pacific Palisades, Calif., with her bundle of joy… all covered up, of course. The beaming mom took her baby to a check-up at a pediatrician's office and was smiling as she pushed him in his stroller. She even bent down and gave Samuel cuddles, who is undoubtedly adorable just like his older sisters Violet and Seraphina."
"Protests erupt in Yemen, Tunisia, Egypt, Gaza, over a film made in the US that insults Prophet Muhammad. A film posted on Youtube that is considered blasphemous has sparked violent protests and attacks on US diplomatic missions in several countries. Here, a Palestinian man burns a US flag during protests in Gaza City on September 12. Enraged protesters over an anti-Islamic film storm the US Embassy in Yemen's capital.

"The Momtract from Mother New York agency grants headship privileges instead of flowers or cards. The Mother New York advertising agency has a suggestion for a gift for your mother, just in time for Mother's Day. Why not give your mother control over an aspect of your life? The Momtract, which they call ""America's most binding gift"", gives your mother authority over one thing in your life. The Momtract is based on the idea that what mothers really want is control, not sweets or flowers."
"Zoho offers a total of 43 different applications in its Zoho One cloud suite, but has more in the works and is betting heavily on artificial intelligence and a new vertical partners strategy to drive additional growth. PLEASANTON, Calif.—Despite operating in the shadow of larger cloud-based enterprise software competitors like Microsoft, Salesforce, and Google, Zoho has achieved impressive customer growth for its well-regarded Zoho One application suite. The jump from 25 million users last year to more than 35 million a year later is notable, as is the fact that Zoho has signed on more than 250,000 businesses or organizations as paid customers."
"The dispute between the US intelligence agencies and their democratically elected president, Donald Trump, is not only strange, but also, for that reason, an extraordinary case study to assess the mandate that should determine the relationship between National Intelligence and the Political Executive in a democratic dispensation. Ideally, the national security apparatus based on Intelligence, exercises the sovereign function of detecting and tracking any threat to national security, whether external or internal, with the aim of neutralizing it in time. At the same time, however, it does so under the authority of the elected Political Executive, who is the ultimate repository of all sovereignty in a democracy."
"The Australian men's water polo team has been agonizingly close to upsetting three-time defending champions Hungary in their qualifying stage semifinal, losing 10-9, and will now play for seventh place on Sunday. As they have shown many times throughout this Olympic campaign, Australia is only a goal or two away from beating the world's best teams on a regular basis. They seriously challenged pre-tournament favorites Serbia in their semifinal before letting a three-goal lead slip away at the end of the match and led today with just five minutes left on the clock."
"The Sparks added some much-needed inside muscle on Wednesday when they completed a three-team trade with the Charlotte Sting and the Sacramento Monarchs. Center Rhonda Mapp and guard E.C. Hill from Charlotte and forward Latasha Byears from Sacramento joined the Sparks, who sent swing player Allison Feaster and center Clarisse Machanguana to Charlotte and forward La'Keshia Frett to Sacramento.

"MBOMBELA - National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete on Saturday appealed to parents in general to be ""kind"" so that their children can open up and express their feelings to them. Mbete was addressing about 3,000 mourners at the KaNyamazane Stadium in Mbombela, Mpumalanga, during the funeral service of Nokhwezi Mthembu, the daughter of African National Congress Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu. ""There is this feeling among our children that, as parents, we want to determine who they should be,"" said Mbete.

"It's a long drive from Billings, Mont., to Lincoln, Neb. – anywhere from 850 to 902 miles, depending on the route you take. But that's the drive that the grizzled and slightly dazed Woody Grant has just embarked on in the opening frames of native Nebraskan Alexander Payne's new film. Payne has been nominated numerous times for directing and writing awards from the Oscars and Golden Globes, and has taken home the gold for writing for ""The Descendants!"", ""Sideways"", and ""About Schmidt""."
"KENTON, Del. - A cheese plant in Kenton shut down by the Food and Drug Administration due to a Listeria outbreak has been inspected 10 times since 2000.

Seven were in Maryland. One died in California. FDA inspectors found a multitude of violations inside and outside the plant during the inspection that took place between February 18 and March 4, 2014."

According to a report in The Independent, the 1,000-year-old mummy was discovered in 2012 in the ancient Peruvian settlement of Pachacamac, near Lima. French archaeologists, who found the mummy curled up in a fetal position, have taken care to preserve the integrity of the remains by keeping them in the same configuration in which they were discovered. The new exhibition at the Musée de Confluences in Lyon will explore various human representations of death across different ages and cultures around the world."
"Guernsey voters are about to elect politicians from a single island-wide constituency, rather than the current district system. More than half of voters backed the change in the island's first referendum, which had a 45% turnout. Option A - a single island-wide district - won with 6,017 votes, representing 52% of the final count. It means all 38 of Guernsey's deputies will be elected in a single vote on the same day, every four years, from June 2020. More Guernsey stories and the latest on the referendum. Option A campaign activist Deputy Carl Meerveld said he was ""ecstatic and relieved""."
"We would also like to hide this list if we were Trump. Is Trump even his name! ""I don't think ISIS likes Acro Cats. I don't think so. They're adorable and they're silly, two things that ISIS hates. In fact, the only thing they have in common is that they're a bunch of kitties."" One of the suits reminded Colbert of an acid trip. We'll take one of each.

"The center of the reconstruction is the warehouse, which was built in 1943, according to the date scribbled in the concrete. It is made of wood. The roof leaks. There is no air conditioning, not even a cold storage unit for fresh fruits and vegetables. The warehouse should have been demolished years ago. But those at Poverello House moved forward, as they always have, accomplishing a lot with very little. When it rains, it fills up with water inside. Extreme temperatures spoil our food. And it poses serious pest control problems."
"Delicious, the original king of online shared bookmarking, is now in the hands of YouTube's founders, after a public outcry saved it from being shut down by Yahoo.

""I told him I know I did the best job possible. I feel good about the 29 years I had with the Cowboys. But it's a bad way for it to end."""
"There are many reasons to be skeptical of the 'smart home' in its current form, but Amazon's virtual assistant Echo shows flashes of real potential. Here's why. I roll my eyes at the concept of the ""smart"" fridge. I don't need my fridge tweeting to tell me I'm out of orange marmalade. Smart toaster! I scoff. And smart locks on your home's doors seem like a particularly silly idea, unless you want to invite burglars in. I can understand why you might want a smart thermostat, like Nest, although it's overpriced."

"It was a situation that left many around the world perplexed, not to mention the passengers on board the British Airways plane. Yesterday, a British Airways passenger plane that was supposed to fly from London to Düsseldorf landed in Edinburgh by mistake after its pilots were given an incorrect flight plan. Flight BA3271 was operated by German company WDL Aviation - which was responsible for the plane and cabin crew - on behalf of BA as part of a leasing agreement. It is understood that one possibility is that on its last flight on Sunday, the plane had flown to Edinburgh and back, and so the same flight plan was repeated again on Monday morning."

Finally warm, he boarded the bus Wednesday night with a backpack full of supplies and a pocket full of money from Troy residents who helped him."
"The Saturday night game was exactly like the Friday night game for the Amarillo Bulls in terms of scoring and results, and if they have one more game like that, they won't have any more games. For the second consecutive night at the Cal Farley Coliseum Complex of the Amarillo Civic Center, the Bulls ended up losing late to the Corpus Christi Ice Rays. This time it happened in extra time, when Corpus Christi's Kyle Moore scored 77 seconds into the extra period to give the Bulls a 6-5 loss in a South Division semifinal series of the North American Hockey League."

"Maenga is unhappy with his press statement against the apology statement of UTM president, Saulos Chilima. If he thinks Malawi is still living in the past, where its police lied to the nation saying Robert Chasowa committed suicide when in fact his party killed him, he is wrong. Today's Malawi is not willing to tolerate nonsense. A few weeks ago, when his party terrorized the nation, his president Peter Mutharika did not utter a word. Under growing pressure, the president instructed Mgeme Kalirani to draft a statement that did not address what the nation expected. To date, his government has not announced the identity of the terrorists nor arrested them."
"The ride-sharing service is returning to Taiwan with a redesigned business model that claims to comply with local regulations this time.

The Florence Fire and EMS said all residents escaped before crews arrived. One resident was taken to a local hospital for evaluation, officials said. No injuries to firefighters were reported."
"With the economy starting to slow down, Ben Bernanke's war against the nation's savers continues. Some of these funds even pay juicy double-digit yields, such as the one my Permanent Wealth Investor subscribers have earned 20% in two years. Dividend capture funds: these funds buy shares in companies that are about to pay a dividend, and then sell the shares after the dividend is paid. By doing this, they can rotate through companies with different payment dates, and thus achieve a high dividend payment. The problem is that shares usually trade lower after a dividend is paid, by the amount of the dividend."

"This paves the way for debt agencies to charge higher fees for overdue loans. According to an analysis on Tuesday by the Consumer Federation of America (CFA), millions of Americans have fallen behind on their student loan payments. The data, obtained from the U.S. Department of Education, reveal that 42.4 million people in the U.S. owed $1.3 trillion in federal student loans as of the end of 2016. Since 2013, the average amount owed per borrower increased by 17 percent.

Ameen sent the emails in February and March while the Senate's Republican leadership insisted that complaints of sexual misconduct and workplace harassment against lawmakers be handled confidentially, either under the Legislature's workplace harassment policy or by prosecutors."
"It was a Saturday morning. August. I remember it with great clarity. I was online, sitting in bed, browsing, not looking for anything in particular. An article caught my attention: it was about the refugee crisis. Men, women, and children were risking their lives to reach Western Europe, and many were dying in the process. It was a story of resilience and terrible trauma. In response, I expected compassion, an increase in feelings of solidarity. But my heart sank as I read the comments. There was a lot of cruelty."
"The Central American referee Carlos Batres has fallen for the worst simulation of the World Cup by the most theatrical Italian since Federico Fellini. In doing so, it cost the All Whites of New Zealand a famous victory over the current world football champions. The scenes were reminiscent of Australia's defeat to Italy in the 2006 World Cup. Then, the 10-man Italian team scored a penalty in injury time after Fabio Grosso fell following a challenge from defender Lucas Neill. Fabio Grosso falls after a challenge from Lucas Neill during the 2006 World Cup. Let's not beat around the bush: Italy, winner of four World Cup crowns, cheated to get back into the game."

Alain Ducasse's Louis XV in Monte Carlo regained the third star it lost last year, giving Mr. Ducasse a total of six stars; his second three-star restaurant, in Paris, bears his name. Pierre Gagnaire, whose restaurant bears his name, regained the third star he lost when he moved from St.-Etienne to Paris two years ago."
"He had the right look with his jeans and defined muscles. Many fans feel that the nickname was an unfortunate byproduct of his success at the time. On Tuesday, November 14, the real Rambo paid a visit to Springsteen in the dressing room after the performance of ""Springsteen on Broadway"". Sylvester Stallone posted two photos on Instagram about it. The first is a photo of Springsteen, Stallone, and actor Benicio Del Toro, the second is a short video of Springsteen bowing to the audience at the end of the show that pans to a smiling and clapping Stallone in the audience.

"The Internet has changed beyond what could have been foreseen just five years ago. It is no longer just a navigation medium: it is full of Web 2.0 applications, real-time communication challenges, and a wide range of threats designed to take advantage of this new use. As a result, web security has changed immeasurably: it is no longer enough to block, stop, or inhibit IP sessions. Web filtering can no longer meet the security challenge on its own. This webinar will explain how Internet use has changed and how your perception of IT may not match what your users are actually doing, resulting in your security controls being bypassed."
"The fourth episode of Aaron Sorkin's The Newsroom is called ""I'll Try to Fix You"". That could perfectly be the title of the entire series. Like Sorkin's The West Wing, the show wants to fix America, this time through the story of Will McAvoy (Jeff Daniels), a successful, cynical, and bored cable news anchor who decides that he, and journalism, and yes, democracy, can do better. What does that mean? Will's producer and ex-girlfriend, MacKenzie McHale (Emily Mortimer), explains: ""Reclaiming the fourth estate""."
"The Israeli ambassador and almost all the staff have been evacuated from the country's embassy in the Jordanian capital, Amman, amidst growing fears of an assault on the mission similar to the attack last week in Egypt. Fears of violent anti-Zionist protests similar to those that erupted in Cairo were awakened after calls for a ""march of a million men"" outside the Israeli embassy in Amman. The action, scheduled for Thursday, had been organized through Facebook. The slogan, ""No to the Zionist embassy on Jordanian territory"", was posted online earlier this week and has already attracted thousands of commitments to attend the demonstration."

I have always paid my bill here. While they always create a fuss each time, they eventually accept my payment."
"My daughter, a resident advisor at her university, complained recently while mentioning that she would probably have to oversee more foreign exchange students this fall. When I asked her why that's a bad thing, she told me that foreign exchange students tend to assume Americans are stupid unless proven otherwise. They assume Americans aren't as well-traveled, or as fluent in foreign languages, or as knowledgeable about world cultures. I said what any good American would say: Why don't they just stay home, then? Oh, she replied, they don't think our universities are stupid."
"A few students have had what could be politely described as a ""disagreement"" at Graham High School. Kim Davis, one of the school's counselors, remains calm and serene as she helps to resolve the issue. It's the type of situation that counselors deal with all the time in all of Alamance County, North Carolina, and the rest of the United States. Davis' determination to do her job well while launching efforts to help students thrive in high school has earned her national recognition. She was a national semifinalist for the 2013 School Counselor of the Year Award by the American School Counselor Association, receiving the award earlier this month."
"I strongly urge the Mayor and Council to move forward to preserve the South Central Corridor. It is the only decision that will preserve the will of the voters, will not jeopardize the funding grant from the Federal Transportation Authority, and will strengthen the value of light rail in Phoenix. Our leaders must stay the course and continue to support this important project. It is the only prudent course of action. Arizona already licenses the full complement of health professions necessary to offer patients a comprehensive approach to addressing chronic pain. It is time for health professions to work together in the best interest of our patients."

"A local state representative is calling for a major overhaul of the state's standardized testing system following the ""litany of errors"" that he claims affected the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR) in 2016. Isaac believes that school districts should be able to choose between national standardized tests while the state fixes the STAAR test. When the STAAR test was last administered in May, issues arose with test administration, along with lost or delayed test materials, errors that erased test results, and mishandling of student private information, according to a press release."

"The Abortion Supervisory Committee of New Zealand is appealing the decision of a High Court judge who said there is reason to doubt the legality of many abortions in the country. A registered professional may legally perform an abortion in New Zealand only if acting under a certificate approved by two consultants, who are appointed by the Abortion Supervisory Committee. The appeal also argues that the Court made a legal error in concluding that the committee can form its own opinion on the legality of the consultants' decisions to grant or deny approval for an abortion."

"Johnny Depp has made a comment about his controversial participation in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald. Depp has been in his own world for quite some time, which has led to some very public controversies. The actor has been accused of domestic violence by his ex-wife Amber Heard, which has not sat well with Harry Potter fans. The fact that the production and J.K. Rowling have kept him in the film has left many fans with a feeling of disappointment.

"RICH KARLGAARD: You have to look at 4 areas. One is financial regulation, which still makes it difficult for small businesses to get loans. You have the healthcare regulations that you mentioned, Obamacare is adding cost burdens everywhere, behind every corner and crack. You have the environmental regulations, and that's a whole area that's killing small businesses, particularly where I live in California. California farmers are being ruined at the expense of protecting certain insects. Then you have labor regulations. Last year we saw how the national labor relations board waged war on Boeing."
"In order to cause ""a distraction"", foreign actors attacked the country's main power stations that ""had equipment manufactured in Canada"", explained María Zakharova, adding that the perpetrators were well aware of ""all the algorithms and weak points"" of Venezuela's power grid. Venezuela began to suffer nationwide blackouts last week. President Nicolás Maduro described the power outages as ""sabotage"" orchestrated by the United States. He said that several ""saboteurs"" have been detained while trying to manipulate the power grid. Previously, he accused Washington of planning a coup against him, among other alleged subversive activities."
"Where were you when you received your 40 Under 40 award? It was 2009 and I was in my ninth year at Grubb & Ellis. In retrospect, I was a young professional, still honing my craft as a broker in the commercial real estate business, building my expertise and fine-tuning my customer service delivery. What has been your greatest achievement since being awarded the prize? Although I appreciate being named a top producer within the company or local market, and I have achieved a high ranking in the volume of deals completed annually, I am more proud of my successes on behalf of my clients."

The plans include an extension to give the building a new lease of life as a community centre and theatre."
"The Japanese manufacturer Mitsubishi will make its first major move in the full-size MPV market this summer with a new and distinctive people carrier called Grandis. Although it is not expected to arrive here until July, the British importer has shown its hand as far as prices are concerned at a very early stage. Full specifications and prices have been announced more than three months ahead of the launch in the clear hope that anyone considering a rival MPV such as the Peugeot 807, Chrysler Voyager or Ford Galaxy will wait to see what the Grandis has to offer."

"This past June, the Tacoma Rainiers brought mascot reindeer Rhubarb and local icon ""Epic Sax Gorilla"" to the rooftop of Cheney Stadium, where the Triple-A club plays, for a crowd-pleasing trick routine. Also on the rooftop was Tacoma News Tribune columnist Matt Driscoll, who recently explained how the rooftop dance earned his employer and the baseball club thousands of dollars in fines from the Washington State Department of Labor & Industries. But hidden somewhere in the pile of public documents I eventually obtained, a single email — from a single individual — helped provide a more complete answer."
"Recently, my elderly mother visited her bank located in the Eastland shopping center in West Covina. As she was leaving, she was approached by a woman carrying a baby in her arms and asking for money for food for her baby, claiming that she had recently arrived from Italy and had no money or means of support. As is so common in elderly people I have known, she didn't hesitate to give the woman five dollars. Being the soft-hearted person that she is, my mother asked her all the sad details. The woman thanked her and approached other people in the parking lot."
"The Jaiprakash Hospital is undergoing renovation these days with the rooms being whitewashed, wall painting, etc. Some new facilities are also being added to the hospital.

The amount sanctioned by the State Government for improving facilities in the hospital is being utilized for the renovation. An additional Rs 18 lakh has been sanctioned to make additional improvements to the hospital."
"Can you put a price on faith? That's the question worshippers are asking themselves as the tradition of tithing, that is, giving 10% of your income to the church, is increasingly being questioned. Opponents of tithing say it's a misinterpretation of the Bible, a man-made practice, not one made by God. They say they should be free to donate the amount they choose, and are arguing with pastors, writing letters, and abandoning congregations in protest. In response, some pastors have changed their teaching and rejected what has been a favorite fundraising method for decades."
"The tide is changing in Frankston, with the Dolphins achieving consecutive wins for the first time in almost six years with a 13-point victory over Collingwood at Victoria Park on Saturday. Coach Simon Goosey had a five-year plan to transform the boys to hit the competition and become finals contenders and the results are evident. Frankston defeated last year's grand final runner-up, Port Melbourne, last week and held firm against a Pies team that finished fast on Saturday. The key, said Goosey, has been recruiting players from the AFL system. Michael Hibberd, Dylan Van Unen, and Mark Baguley are at Essendon, while Marcus Marigliani was on the Bombers' list in 2011."
"The sad demise of veteran actor Kader Khan has left a void in the Hindi film industry that cannot be filled.

"Will Chelsea change tack vs. Arsenal? Judging by their body language, you would never think Chelsea are just two points off the top of the Premier League table. After a defeat in extra-time to Sunderland in the Capital One Cup quarterfinals on Tuesday, José Mourinho looked like a disheveled man, a strange mix of irritability, tiredness and defensiveness. ""It's possible we have to take a step back to be more consistent in defense,"" he said. ""It's something I don't want to do, to play more on the counterattack, but I'm considering it seriously."
"TOKYO (AFP) - Almost half of Tokyo's residents couldn't name a single Paralympian and international sports officials are worried about the city's preparation to host athletes.

"SANTA MARIA, Brazil – The lack of investment by a band known for its pyrotechnic stage shows may have cost the lives of more than 230 people in a nightclub in southern Brazil, according to a state police inspector leading the investigation into the deadly fire over the weekend. Inspector Marcelo Arigony told reporters at a Tuesday news conference that band members knowingly purchased flares meant for outdoor use because they cost only $1.25 each, compared to the $35 price tag for an indoor flare. ""The flare that was lit was only for outdoor use, and the people who lit it know that,"" Arigony said."
"In fact, for Sunday, temperatures are expected to be back in the 50s, and then possibly in the upper 70s by January 10. But first, the National Weather Service expects mostly sunny skies and a high of 59 degrees on Tuesday. The front will make its entrance into Fort Worth mid-day, but probably won't be felt until nighttime hours, making Wednesday a cold wake-up with the temperature fluctuating just above freezing. Wednesday's high is forecast to be 46 degrees with partly cloudy skies, followed by a low of 28."
"Several bills in the New Jersey statehouse are of interest to truckers and others who use the roads throughout the state. Repeat drunk-driving offenders could soon face stiffer penalties for their actions. New Jersey law now limits punishment for affected offenders to a traffic offense. Bail is typically $2,500. The traffic offense designation allows drivers accused of drunken driving to continue driving while they await their court date. Under consideration on the Assembly floor is a bill to put an end to that practice. Instead, A3057 would increase punishment for someone convicted of driving under the influence two or more times within 60 days to a fourth-degree crime."
"The star of ""The Lord of the Rings"", Liv Tyler, stepped out with just her husband for the day. The Hollywood star could barely contain her smile as she watched the horse racing on the second day of the Cheltenham Festival, on March 15. Dressed all in black, the mother of three beamed brightly as she peered through her binoculars to get a glimpse of the racing. The stunning brunette wore a black silk dress that fell just above her ankles, with a cuff and a butterfly-patterned belt around her waist. She added a wide-brimmed black hat and clutched a small black purse with a floral design for Ladies' Day at the festival."
"Why is a flamboyant Dutch journalist on the payroll of the former Alaska governor's political action committee? A Mother Jones investigation. In recent months, Sarah Palin's political action committee, SarahPAC, has paid thousands of dollars to a mysterious company that has gone to great lengths to conceal its ownership. Addresses linked to the firm lead to post office boxes. It has no website. Not even a phone number. Not even the California lawyer who incorporated the company knew who was behind it. But a Mother Jones investigation has discovered that this firm is run by an unlikely foreign political operative."
"CARILLÓN BEACH: Organic living comes naturally to Leia and Andy Mayer, and their Sunrise Market & Café is just an extension of that lifestyle. ""I love how friendly everyone is. The culture here is really interesting. And I love the beaches and the sun,"" Leia said Thursday while making pancakes from scratch at the café. She and Andy moved from Northern California to Seaside in February. The Mayers have embraced the Carillon Beach community, opening the café on March 21 and hosting the Carillon Beach Farmers Market this summer."
"The Bible teaches: ""Resist the devil and he will flee from you"" (James 4:7). It also tells us to stay away from those who are guided by various appetites (see 1 Tim. 3:5-6). Many great people in God have fallen into carnal temptations and have potentially ruined their lives and ministries. One person has said: ""It takes a lifetime to build integrity and a minute to lose it."" This is a true saying! I believe that one of the most important reasons why leaders fall is that most have never intentionally established mental and emotional firewalls."
"Former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke was sentenced on Friday to six years and nine months for the murder of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, more than four years after the shooting. Jason Van Dyke, the former Chicago cop whose fatal 2014 shooting of African-American teenager Laquan McDonald reignited the passionate national conversation about police shootings, was sentenced on Friday to six years and nine months in prison. The veteran police officer was convicted in October of second-degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery with a firearm for the October 2014 shooting. The shooting and its video sparked protests across Chicago and calls for Van Dyke to face serious prison time."
"Led Zeppelin stole from the '60s group Spirit! And did ""The Voice"" steal from ""American Idol""? A recent court case has the estate of the composer of ""Taurus"" claiming that ""Stairway To Heaven"" violates copyright laws. Creatives have been borrowing from each other for centuries. But what constitutes real harm - commercial, artistic, or otherwise? How much of the original art was transferred to the new effort? This is always the blurry part. Music copyright lawsuits have been happening for over a century."
"detailed update process, I hope it can be useful for you if you don't have experience with this before. Let me take care of the back side and loosen the screws. Be careful, the keyboard connection with the blue connector is slippery, pull it out gently! Take the back side again and start disassembling the screws in a row. Remove the back shelf. Now start replacing the SSD. Good. It fits perfectly with the slot. Assemble the screws so they fit the SSD. Evaluate the SSD score, it amazes me again, 7.8 points. As far as I know, the highest score is 7.9."

"Jeremy Tucker is leaving the top marketing post at Nissan North America to ""pursue other opportunities,"" according to the automaker. A well-informed source says Tucker, who was Nissan's vice president of marketing communications and media, was fired. However, Tucker describes it as a ""mutually agreed-upon separation."" Sales at the automaker have been unimpressive and there has been some discontent among dealers about the lack of national brand advertising, according to another source. The automaker's total sales in the 2018 calendar year in the US fell 6.2% compared to the previous year."

She previously served as the editor-in-chief of the Columbia Journal and as a blog editor at Asymptote and Words Without Borders. If Poe had lived to read Alejandra Pizarnik, she would have given him nightmares. Revered by writers such as Octavio Paz, Roberto Bolaño, and César Aira—the latter calling her ""the greatest, and the last"" poet—Pizarnik is one of the most important contributors to 20th-century Argentine poetry."
"Albion striker Simon Cox has emerged as a transfer target for Championship club Derby County. Rams boss Nigel Clough is keeping a close eye on the 23-year-old and will consider a loan move if there is any encouragement from Hawthorns. Sources in the East Midlands confirmed today that the former Reading and Swindon player is on a list of strikers being monitored by Clough, who is looking to strengthen his attack. The Pride Park boss is also interested in highly-rated Gary Hooper of Scunthorpe, Billy Sharp of Sheffield United and James Vaughan of Everton, who he signed on loan last season."
"Ken Block makes incredible gymkhana videos. But the NSW police didn't want Ken Block to make this particular gymkhana video — the one you see just above — in Sydney. So the Hoonigan team went to New York instead, leaving Australia in the dust. Here's the video they made — the video that could have featured the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Opera House and all of our city's most famous icons. Ken Block's Gymkhana Nine was filmed to coincide with the release of Forza Horizon 3, set in Australia — so it made sense that Gymkhana Nine would be filmed in Australia."

"The images we've published from Yemen can be as disturbing as anything we've ever used before. Here's why we made the decision to publish them. Amal Hussain is a 7-year-old Yemeni girl with a worried gaze whose image is at the top of our latest report from Yemen, a country embroiled in war and on the brink of catastrophic famine. Amal is skin and bones, and her head is turned to one side, as if she can't bear to meet the gaze of those looking at her. Some readers may feel that they also want to look away."
"Ballinhassig 4-17 Castlelyons 1-12: A polished performance in the second half propelled Ballinhassig to a crushing victory over Castlelyons in the Cork Premier Hurling Championship quarter-final on Saturday afternoon. Inspired by Danny O'Callaghan and backed by five members of the Cork intermediate team, the Carrigdhoun outfit showed many of the attributes that could see them quickly return to the senior ranks. While the forwards will grab the headlines, it was O'Callaghan's performance and the solidity of the Blues' midfield line that launched their offensive in the second half and a 2-11 return (2-10 from play) on the scoreboard."
"The US trade policy has become the top concern among financial directors, according to a quarterly CNBC survey. Approximately two-thirds of financial directors in North America and Asia-Pacific say that the US trade policy will have a negative impact on their company over the next six months. Seven of the 16 largest drops in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index this year have been triggered by trade concerns. US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin appeared on Capitol Hill on Thursday to face questioning about trade, tariffs, and NAFTA from the House Financial Services Committee. Mnuchin attempted to calm the growing uncertainty within Congress as President Trump escalates a trade war with China."
"January 29, 2015: Follow the money. One of the reasons the new peace talks are progressing is because factions with responsibilities over large portions of the population are willing to compromise if it will help halt the accelerated decline in living standards across the country. Economic activity is decreasing and shortages are increasing due to infighting between factions and especially because two governments claim to rule the entire country. Then there's all the Islamic terrorist violence. Although most Libyans appreciate the help of the Islamic terrorist groups in overthrowing Kaddafi in 2011, since then these groups have become a greater threat than Kaddafi's secret police ever was."
"What exactly sets people apart from machines! Two things, really: creativity and empathy. No matter what develops in artificial intelligence, these are the two elements that can keep the agency services business alive and keep marketers busy for years. Artificial intelligence is a complement to what you do, it's designed to enhance your abilities. Artificial intelligence can create a level of efficiency that companies otherwise lack and free them up to do the kind of work that has incremental impact. Agencies have been successful in the past because they are creative."
