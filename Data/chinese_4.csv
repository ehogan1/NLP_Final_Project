"For small businesses that operate on credit, accounts receivable make up a large portion of the balance sheet. During the annual audit, the auditor will verify that there is sufficient evidence to support your claims about the accounts receivable balance. These claims are called assertions. The most common audit procedure for accounts receivable is confirmation, in which the auditor will ask your customers to confirm their account balances. Understanding which assertions can be verified through confirmation helps you understand why your auditor may need to perform multiple audit procedures on the same account. Accounts receivable confirmation is primarily used to verify the existence assertion."
"It's a good thing I'm not Jim Furyk today. 1. The US team took a four-point lead into Sunday's singles at the Ryder Cup, with the home crowd expecting another dominant day. 2. Luke Donald beat Bubba Watson in the first match of the day to make it 10-7, but the US still held a strong lead. Whatever. 3. Europe's Paul Lawrie completely dismantled Brandt Snedeker to add another point for Europe. 4. At least Keegan Bradley, the best American player all weekend, was able to go head-to-head with Rory McIlroy."
"This kind of thing often happens: you press the snooze button on your alarm clock once, twice, or even three times, so when you finally get up, wash, dress, and get ready to face the new day, you've already fallen behind schedule. Usually, this results in you skipping breakfast altogether. It turns out that your breakfast habits are a time-saving technique that should not be neglected. Firstly, research shows that eating a nutritious, protein-rich, and balanced breakfast every morning is an effective way to activate your brain, improve focus, and enhance performance. Additionally, eating breakfast is also associated with better weight control, as it provides energy for the body and may reduce hunger later in the day."

"The best Halloween costume ideas come from the most unforgettable moments of the year, and 2016 was undoubtedly a year to remember. We witnessed the Summer Olympics and the US Presidential Election, two events that dominate headlines (and Facebook timelines!) every four years. Add to that Beyoncé's visual album masterpiece, the Pokémon Go phenomenon, and the colorful, quotable chaos of Suicide Squad, and 2016 was basically begging for a Halloween costume party. We've become Halloween experts - creating over 1 billion pages of Halloween content. This is our time to shine."

"We first looked at which major brands had the highest maintenance costs over the first 10 years of driving. We grouped all models by brand and year to calculate the average cost per brand. To estimate the annual maintenance cost, we found the cost of maintenance every other oil change cycle (because oil changes are typically done every six months). Without a doubt, German imports led by a wide margin. Toyota and its two brands, Lexus and Subaru, were among the cheapest brands, with owners saving at least $10,000 in maintenance costs over 10 years compared to BMW."

"Veteran Congressman Jim Leach, a Republican from Iowa, lost his seat in the 2006 election. I'm not defending ""moderate Republicans"" per se, but it's worth noting. In my opinion, Leach was absolutely the best Republican in the House. Nevertheless, one can only be glad about his defeat. The fact that it happened just goes to show how bad the entire Republican Party has become. Leach was a person with genuinely good instincts and some basically correct ideas about how the US should conduct itself in the world, but he was useless in practice."
"Trump's tweets have long raised questions about whether they violate Twitter's anti-harassment rules. On Monday, after Trump tweeted that North Korea may ""not be around much longer,"" Twitter was forced to explain why it didn't ban the president from the service. Twitter's public policy account posted a series of six tweets in which the company said it considers ""newsworthiness"" and ""public interest"" when determining whether a user has violated its rules. Twitter said these considerations have long been used internally to decide the fate of problematic accounts. The company stated that its rules are intended to ensure all users can use the service safely, but also consider whether certain tweets have news value or serve the public interest. In this case, Twitter considered Trump's tweet, although controversial, to be of news value and in the public interest, and therefore took no action."
"No one can accurately predict when the stock market will end its record bull run, but the best way for investors to prepare for the next economic downturn is to remain calm and stick to a prudently devised plan. The Star spoke to Ashley Feinstein Gerstley, author of 30-Day Money Cleanse: Take Control of Your Finances, Manage Your Spending, and Get Out of Debt Fast, to ask why people struggle so much with money — and how they can do better. People also often overlook or inadvertently misreport other common expenditures."

"South Bend, Indiana -- The Irish took to the practice field for the final time on Thursday morning ahead of the Blue Gold Game on Saturday. As spring practice comes to a close, one of the biggest questions the team faced is still unanswered: who will emerge at the outside linebacker position? Defensive coordinator Clark Lea said that fifth-year outside linebacker Asmar Bilal is currently the closest to being ""solid"" in the unit, but he seems content with the uncertainty. He believes the position has made huge progress over the past month and a half, but with several months still to go before the first week, he's not in a rush to have everything settled. Despite not having made a decision at the position, Lea is pleased with the progress the team has made and is confident they will find the right guy over the next few months."

"German business confidence fell to its lowest level in two and a half years in October, marking a sixth consecutive month of decline, eliminating any doubts that the largest economy in Europe is being affected by the euro zone debt crisis. The Munich-based think tank Ifo Institute said on Wednesday that its business climate index, which is based on a monthly survey of more than 7,000 companies, fell to 100.0 in October from 101.4 in September.

"The life of thought has always been an enigma to poets and neuroscientists who try to map and mark it, but for me, it's about finding it. In Irish tradition, thinking itself is something worth thinking about, and therefore, there are many concepts in the Irish language that involve thought, dreams, and imagination. As a student, many nuances are still unclear to me, but language is about conversation. I would love to hear more mature insights from native Irish speakers about words related to thinking in Irish."

This led to a sharp correction in the bull market, wiping out previous gains, and the market eventually closed in negative territory.

"Two years ago, I was sitting in a South Atlantic League baseball game (Low-A) watching the Hagerstown Suns host the visiting Greensboro Grasshoppers. Behind me, two Greensboro pitchers, Trevor Richards and Ben Meyer, were charting the game. As I mentioned, neither of the two pitchers seemed to be on the radar screen of any major league teams. Richards went undrafted out of a small college in 2015, so he had to start his professional career with the Gateway Grizzlies of the independent Frontier League. After a strong 2016 with Greensboro, he was signed by the Miami Marlins."
"The United Nations, August 26 -- As media predictions of a possible US missile strike on Syria continue to grow, one cannot help but ask: will the US still launch a strike even if the UN investigation team is still in Syria, and even if they find something in the suburbs of Damascus?

"Recent research has shown that patients with dementia can derive great benefits from art therapy. While many people believe that a healthy diet and exercise are the keys to healthy aging, the International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry found that certain personality traits can also have a huge impact on your life in old age. We all lead busy lives, but if you have recently moved into an assisted living house or a memory care cottage, it is even more important to stay in touch with your loved ones. Nutrition is important for everyone, but it is especially crucial for the elderly."

According to Simpson, the roads become busier in the summer because young drivers are more frequently on the road since they are no longer in school. ""Kids are out of school on summer break, or college kids are home on summer break, so you see more young drivers on the road, going to events or going to work, they're not spending 6-7 hours a day in school,"" Simpson said."

"As Californians, as people with a voice, we should know what it means to displace people from their land. In the 1950s and 60s, California funded expeditions every year to remove all Native Americans from the entire region.

"A cancer expert has discovered a way to kill tumors using light in just two hours. The technique involves injecting a chemical compound and then exposing it to ultraviolet light. In laboratory mice, it was found that cancer cells self-destructed, with up to 95% of cancer cells dying within two hours. Professor Matthew Gdovin revealed that the cancer cells he injected with the compound nitrobenzaldehyde became too acidic to survive. After applying for a patent for the ""photodynamic"" treatment, he said: ""There are many different types of cancer, but they all share the property of being susceptible to this induced cell suicide."""
"Recently, drones have appeared in various shapes and sizes, but generally speaking, most drones still belong to one of two categories. One category is the multi-rotor type (quadcopters, hexacopters, octocopters, etc.), and the other category is the fixed-wing type. Both types of drones have their advantages and disadvantages. Multi-rotor drones are generally more stable and easier to fly, but are much slower than fixed-wing drones that focus on accelerating forward. On the other hand, fixed-wing drones can fly faster and farther than their hovering counterparts, but are more difficult to operate because they cannot take off and land vertically."
"Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche Holding Ltd. said on Monday it had received reports of 13 cases of H1N1 flu developing resistance to oseltamivir, marketed under the brand name Tamiflu, a very low proportion.

The 13 cases were scattered across the globe, including Europe, the United States, and Asia."
"Russian President Putin described Turkey's downing of a Russian warplane as ""a stab in the back by accomplices of terrorism"" and said the incident would have serious consequences. Before meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah on Tuesday, Putin said at the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi that the downed plane was attacked in Syrian airspace, just 1 kilometer from the Turkish border, and crashed 4 kilometers inside Syria. This contradicts Turkey's claim that the plane was repeatedly warned before it was shot down for violating Turkish airspace."
"Arsene Wenger believes that the recovery of England forward Theo Walcott, plus the impending return of German international Lukas Podolski, means that Arsenal do not need to feel extra pressure to buy another striker in January. The Gunners will resume domestic action on Saturday, hoping to revive their fortunes by beating third-placed Southampton to maintain their position at the top of the Barclays Premier League. Walcott will face his former club two months after undergoing abdominal surgery.

The Gunners are hoping that the return of Walcott and Podolski will help them maintain their position at the top of the league."
"The New York Knicks have completed a quarter of their schedule with a mediocre 9-9 record, aiming to end their 43-year championship drought. Coach Jeff Hornacek and the Knicks will have an advantage in December as they face their opponents. The month will feature 15 games, with only five opponents having a winning percentage above 50%. They will host the 5-13 Minnesota Timberwolves at home on Friday. Joakim Noah, Derrick Rose, and Carmelo Anthony are undoubtedly the biggest stars on the team, but their performance has not yet met expectations. Anthony's team-high 22.2 points per game average is slightly higher than last season. Hornacek and the Knicks hope to achieve more wins in December to lay the foundation for the team's playoff journey."
"Hashem's bookstore was always a beacon of knowledge and a destination for readers and intellectuals until 2000, when the number of visitors began to decline due to the difficult economic situation in the Gaza Strip.

"Google's relationship with China has been strained, after the search giant essentially pulled out of the country following accusations that the Chinese government supported hacking attacks on the company's systems and employees.

"To end the war on whistleblowers, the Espionage Act needs to be reformed. Over the past 100 years, the law has evolved into a tool for government secrecy. The evolution of the Espionage Act has had a profound impact on the freedom of modern American political debate. Initially, the law was a vague mandate that granted President Woodrow Wilson the power to imprison critics and censor the media during World War I. Today, it has transformed into a powerful law that regulates political discourse by controlling secrets rather than speech. Censorship did not stop with the end of the war, it has evolved. Despite its name, the Espionage Act has always been a broad mandate."

"Conservative Party leader William Hague walked through a crowd of loyal supporters on his way to lunch on Tuesday, when the host introduced him as ""the next prime minister"", which triggered sudden laughter, and even many of his supporters couldn't help but laugh.

"From the M1917 to the M1A2, American tanks have dominated the battlefield. The US Army and Marine Corps are approaching a nearly century-long milestone - the 100th anniversary of American tank service. This dynamic GIF created by the staff of partcatalog.com shows the evolution of American tanks, from the creaky M1917 light tank to the M1A2 Abrams tank, demonstrating how the US went from being a novice in the world of tanks to a world leader. For example, the M1917 light tank was simply a copy of the Renault FT-17. Such engineering plagiarism is unimaginable today. Over the past 100 years, the US Army and Marine Corps have made tremendous progress, driving the development of tank technology and making the US the world's leading tank manufacturer."
"Among these groups, the most notable name is Bajrang Dal, whose radicals burned alive an Australian missionary Graham Staines and his two minor sons in Orissa in 1999. This heartbreaking incident is often cited as one of the early examples of ""saffron terror"" in India.

"M. Night Shyamalan's 2017 horror film Split, the most exciting part was the ending, which was also one of the few things the movie got right. The appearance of Bruce Willis's David Dunn character from Unbreakable in a brief, surprising scene at the end created a shared universe that Shyamalan was eager to exploit. However, there is a huge gap between giving fans a brief cameo and building a story around it. As the third installment of the trilogy, Glass looks like a messy amalgam of half-baked ideas, forming an unbalanced chaos."

"Senior tech executives discussed the impact of automation technology on their organizations. For many organizations and employees, technological automation is both an opportunity and a threat. On the one hand, the use of robotic process automation and other tools can improve efficiency by automating manual and repetitive tasks. On the other hand, it has the potential to make jobs redundant. Recently, tech executives gathered at roundtable meetings in Sydney and Melbourne to discuss the impact of automation technology on their organizations. One key issue was how to ensure compliance with governance policies and procedures when ""robots"" replace humans in executing business tasks. Other issues discussed included how to manage the changes brought about by automation technology and how to ensure that employees are able to adapt to new technologies and new ways of working.

"Edgar Wright has never made a bad film, he has never even made a mediocre one. It is therefore understandable that Wright has so far avoided making direct sequels throughout his career. However, this could be about to change with the arrival of Baby Driver. When Shaun of the Dead was a success, Wright, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost did not capitalize on the film's success by making a zombie sequel, instead opting to work with Pegg and Frost on a thematically linked trilogy - the ""Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy"" - which also included the equally excellent Hot Fuzz and The World's End."

"I first heard these scriptures in a small chapel in Kiev, Ukraine. I remember the day because it was a Sunday morning and the news of Princess Diana's death was being reported. I had just left my job on Wall Street and was living with my mother in Kiev because my father had passed away, and I was there because I felt lost and without direction. I recall sitting in the back of the room, surrounded by wooden walls, feeling a bit self-conscious among my fellow foreign companions' passionate preaching. But when I heard these scriptures, my thoughts were drawn back in."

It's just that super producer David Stern is no longer behind the scenes manipulating everything (otherwise the New York team would somehow win the draft lottery). Instead, the league stumbles forward like an over-budget, out-of-control Hollywood blockbuster - driven by the egos of star players, filled with jaw-dropping plot twists, and suffering from endless rewrites. And it gets worse: we haven't even mentioned the Los Angeles Lakers yet. Unfortunately, the biggest news so far this season has nothing to do with basketball."
"Doug Newcomb 2015 Lincoln MKC If you're looking for a stylish and relatively affordable luxury crossover that's an alternative to the usual imports, the 2015 Lincoln MKC is an attractive choice. Relatively affordable. Wide range of driver assistance options. Quiet ride. Outdated infotainment interface. Less engine power than some competitors. If you're looking for a stylish and relatively affordable luxury crossover that's an alternative to the usual imports, the 2015 Lincoln MKC is an attractive choice. While Ford has been setting sales records and earning profits, its luxury brand Lincoln has been lagging behind its competitors."
"NASA plans to insert a small robot into a volcano in Hawaii to collect data and geographical features such as fissures and volcanic vents to map the inside of the volcano. Currently, a similar robot is exploring the volcano. Dr. Carolyn Parcheta, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said: ""We don't totally understand how volcanoes erupt, we have some models, but they're all very, very simplified. The goal of this project is to help make those models more realistic."" According to NASA, the robot developed by NASA can crawl into areas that humans cannot enter."
"Hearst Magazines will be very busy in 2018, completing its acquisition of Rodale, buying some magazines in the Netherlands, and increasing the frequency of its two newest magazines. The Pioneer Woman, a joint venture between Hearst Magazines and blogger and Food Network star Ree Drummond, published two best-selling issues in 2017 and will increase its frequency to four issues in 2018. In his annual year-end memo, Hearst Magazines President David Carey noted that it's a good time to be in the magazine business, citing Airbnb's failed attempt to launch its own magazine, Pineapple, in 2014, which only lasted one issue. Hearst Magazines will also complete its acquisition of Rodale and buy some magazines in the Netherlands in 2018, moves that signal the company's confidence in the magazine business."
"Activists insist that future meetings about the downtown area of Dundee should include discussions on accessibility facilities for people with disabilities. What was supposed to be a pleasant experience of Turkish desserts, however, turned into a bittersweet one due to the chaos caused by the St Johnstone match in the UEFA Cup. A nursery in Dundee failed to increase its childcare slots. Dundee inventor John Crookshank died at the age of 84. What started as a provocative act spread rapidly around the world. Angus Council ordered a retired couple in Monifieth to remove all bird feeders from their front yard."
"The daughter of a Kannada tabloid editor today claimed her father was ""innocent"" and would ""come out clean"" from the case. Her father was arrested for allegedly hiring a hitman to kill his colleague journalist. Ravi Belagere, the publisher of Hi Bangalore, was arrested from his residence yesterday for allegedly hiring a ""supari"" killer from Vijayapura in northern Karnataka to kill Sunil Heggaravalli. ""In this case, no one has filed the first information report based on someone's complaint, it's a case registered by the police on their own based on the statement of the killer."
"Manatees are large, gray, aquatic mammals. They have full bodies - I'm sure clothing companies would try to say that manatees are ""voluptuous"", trying to convince them to buy plus-sized jeans - that taper into a flat, paddle-like tail. Adult manatees are typically about 10 feet long and weigh between 800 and 1,200 pounds. Manatees are one of the ugliest sea creatures created by God, and there are many strange creatures in the sea. These facts come from the website of the ""Save the Manatee Club"" - interestingly, the observation of ugliness is subjective, but it is obvious enough to be considered a fact."

"French woman Isabelle Dinoire, who underwent the world's first face transplant, showed off her new look to the public on Monday. Speaking in a somewhat slurred voice, she said she now looks ""like anyone else"" and hopes to resume a normal life. Isabelle's pronunciation was a bit hard to understand, but she recounted her experience of being attacked by a dog last year and thanked the donor's family for giving her new lips, chin, and nose. In a 15-hour operation on November 27, doctors in Amiens transplanted facial tissue onto her face, which still bears a small circular scar."
"Did Donald Trump release his tax returns. For a moment, it seemed like Rachel Maddow had gotten a genuine scoop. Then, suddenly, it turned out... thanks to MSNBC in the US, the claim that Trump ""paid no taxes for 18 years"" was proven to be false. Additionally, Trump's tax rate in 2005 seemed to be higher than that of most politicians, and his income was quite substantial. However, we can't be certain if the report was selectively extracted."
"Pleasant Mount, Lackawanna County - School officials are requiring students who have not received the latest vaccine to stay home for several weeks as St. Peter's County deals with a mumps outbreak. According to Dr. Sam Ray, superintendent of the North St. Peter School District, there are two confirmed cases of mumps in St. Peter's County, one of which is a student in the school district, he said. Another potential case of mumps is awaiting test results from health officials, Ray said. Ray did not specify which school the student with mumps attends, but said North St. Peter High School is ""involved"" in the outbreak."
"During difficult times, creative bakers turned to desperation pies: vinegar pie and green tomato pie, which are typically not on America's list of favorite desserts. However, these and other desperation pies still exist today, showcasing the resourcefulness of home cooks during the Great Depression. Some desperation pies, such as the green tomato pie, still have a loyal following today. Imagine being a thrifty farmer during the Great Depression, wanting to make a dessert for your family, but traditional pie ingredients, such as cherries or pecans, were too expensive or inaccessible."
"There is a Speed Graphic camera here, which was once the standard equipment in newsrooms across the country. You may have seen them in movies from the 1930s and 1940s, with photographers wearing fedoras and press passes on their hat bands. The Speed Graphic was a huge and heavy camera that required flashbulbs the size of light bulbs to take pictures at night, and it was the first professional camera I used when I worked on my high school yearbook and a part-time newspaper in high school and college. I have a Speed Graphic in my office, which uses sheet film - you take a picture, then pull out the slide and load another one."
"Anyone who has ever been frustrated with taking video in low-light conditions will be excited about Canon's strange and amazing new camera that can shoot full HD color video in almost complete darkness. The camera, called the ""multipurpose"" MH20F-SH, has a 2.26 megapixel full-frame sensor. The reason for the lower resolution is that each pixel is extremely large - precisely 19 micrometers, which is 7.5 times the size of the pixels on Canon's flagship DSLR, the 1Dx."
"Is our efficient tax authority stifling the country? I have never seen the central bank release a report urging the government to cut taxes. But in fact, this partly explains why the economy is going downhill. In fact, as can be seen from these rare historical data, Tax Commissioner Chris Jordan and his team have done an excellent job in cracking down on corporate over-claiming. With the increase in productivity brought about by computer technology, the government's tax revenue has increased dramatically."
"Facility managers wear many hats, and it's not uncommon for a facility manager to lead meetings, provide plumbing advice, offer decorating ideas, and ensure the floors are properly cleaned all in one day. When considering facility operations, facility managers consider the safety and well-being of all building occupants. To be a successful facility manager, one must have a strong management background, technical skills, basic knowledge of construction, and knowledge of the technical aspects. Facility managers are responsible for overseeing the physical facilities of a building or a campus."
"A professor of communications at Texas A&M University wanted to understand the impact of changes in the newspaper industry on politics in our country, so she conducted some research and published it in the Journal of Communications. If you've noticed that political polarization seems to have increased significantly over the past few years, you're not imagining things. Johanna Dunaway of Colorado State University and Louisiana State University, and her colleagues, found that this polarization occurred nationwide during a period when the number of local newspapers and journalists decreased. As Johanna Dunaway and her colleagues found, during a period when the number of local newspapers and journalists decreased nationwide, political polarization also increased."
"Washington -- An Iowa egg producer apologized Wednesday before a congressional subcommittee and acknowledged that his family business had ""gotten too big"" before it started implementing some necessary complex procedures to ensure compliance with all government regulations. ""What I mean is we got big and then we started putting in place some of the necessary complex procedures to ensure we met all of the government requirements,"" egg producer Austin J. DeCoster testified before the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee. He is the founder of DeCoster Egg Farms, which has been linked to multiple deadly salmonella outbreaks in several states over the past three decades. DeCoster's company is believed to be at the center of the recent salmonella outbreak. DeCoster Egg Farms is a vast empire that has been the source of multiple salmonella outbreaks over the years."
"The Conservative candidate was disqualified for failing to disclose his drink-driving conviction, for which he was later found guilty. Ben Wong, 48, who owns a takeaway in Silver Street called the New Dragon Palace, had been standing for the Conservatives in the Victoria ward by-election on May 2, but was disqualified after being found guilty. The deadline for nominations had passed on April 3, but he had failed to notify the local Somerset Conservatives of his appearance at Yeovil Magistrates' Court on March 21."
"Battfleck is officially no more! Ben Affleck has formally stepped down from his role as Bruce Wayne in The Batman, passing the torch to a new actor. Warner Bros. had previously announced the official release date for the standalone DC adventure film, set to hit theaters on June 25, 2021. Shortly after the news broke, Ben Affleck took to social media to congratulate director Matt Reeves, who will be leading the Caped Crusader into the future. The tweet was later confirmed to be Affleck's way of bidding farewell to the character."
"When dining out, it's common to leave a tip, but a gratuity added to an order of a milkshake and fries at a New Jersey restaurant has left parents outraged. ""My daughter came to tell me that every time she and her friends go to the restaurant, they're being charged a tip,"" Melissa Desh said. ""When I asked her why, she said, 'because they're kids,'"" Desh said. Her daughter, Isabella, and other students from Colfax Middle School frequently visit the Wayne Hills Diner, located across from Hamburg Turnpike."
"Dallas - Like many Americans, Martin Jacobson was thrilled by the news of the Navy SEALs killing Osama bin Laden. But the Dallas resident has a deeper connection to the elite special forces unit that hunted down the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. Decades ago, he was one of them. During World War II, Jacobson was a member of the precursor to the SEALs, an elite unit known for keeping a low profile, but was back in the headlines after the bin Laden raid. ""I'm just proud of the SEALs,"" said the 89-year-old Jacobson."
"Northern Ireland is today dubbed the race hate capital of Europe, a report on racial violence in the province concludes. Human rights campaigner Doreen Lawrence, mother of murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence, attended the launch of the report in Belfast by the Northern Ireland Council for Ethnic Minorities (NICEM). The report highlights institutional racism within the justice system and questions how it is being addressed. Racial violence in Northern Ireland has been on the increase in recent years, targeting not just black and Asian people, but almost anyone perceived as being different."
"Approximately 300 villagers in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, submitted a petition to the Chinese Embassy in Phnom Penh yesterday and protested in front of the provincial government building, calling on Prime Minister Hun Sen for help. The villagers told The Post that they want to put an end to the land disputes caused by ""land grabbing"" by companies, and stated that they would not return home unless a solution is found, even if it means death. They claimed that government departments have ignored their pleas for help, while companies have used the judicial system to arrest villagers who complain about land clearance."
"The incline bench press is a strength training exercise that targets the upper chest and anterior shoulders. The exercise is performed on an incline bench, where the lifter lies on the bench and grasps a dumbbell or barbell with an overhand grip, then presses the weight upwards over the chest by extending and flexing the elbows. Alternatively, an incline chest press machine can be used to replicate the movement, with the machine moving along a fixed plane. The incline bench press is one of several exercises that can help create a symmetrical and strong upper body."
"Klopp revealed his delight at ending Guardiola's Manchester City's 22-game unbeaten run, exclaiming ""What is that?!"" on live television, while the Liverpool manager also hit back at critics who said his defence was vulnerable, adding ""blow my shoes off!"" Klopp was ecstatic after Liverpool beat title favourites Manchester City 4-3. In a thrilling match at Anfield, Liverpool were 4-1 up at half-time, with City scoring two late goals to make for a tense finish."
"No one asked me, but... if you pay dues to a neo-Nazi organization, subscribe to racist publications, buy tickets to Holocaust denial conferences, and own Holocaust denial DVDs in your video collection, you might be a neo-Nazi. You don't become a neo-Nazi overnight. You can change your mind and the way you think, and become a new person. If you want people to believe you're no longer a neo-Nazi, you'll have to do a lot of convincing. It takes a lot of effort to shed the brown shirt."
"Brent Moloney's first step towards making amends for his off-field drinking antics in the finals series was his quiet reinstatement into the club's leadership group midway through the season. The second step was far more public and significant, with Moloney winning the Melbourne Football Club's best and fairest award last night. The 27-year-old won the Keith 'Bluey' Truscott Trophy at Crown Palladium, narrowly edging out key defender Jared Rivers and James Frawley in the voting. Moloney's two midfield teammates, Nathan Jones and Jack Trengove, finished fourth and fifth respectively."
"The Weeknd will collaborate with Daft Punk at the Grammys. LOS ANGELES (AP) - The Weeknd will collaborate with electronic music duo Daft Punk at the Grammys.

"Dartmouth - On Flag Day, June 14, students from the James M. Quinn Elementary School in Dartmouth gathered outside to celebrate the occasion. The event itself was not unusual, but this year's ceremony held a deeper meaning for them. The reason was that Ted Cote, the cousin of Dr. Carole Calafati from New Bedford, was serving in Iraq. Earlier this year, around Veterans Day, Dr. Calafati asked her students to send cards to Corporal Ted Cote in Iraq to boost his morale. The students responded by making cards and sending them to Iraq."
"Will UBS appoint Bob McCann or Sallie Krawcheck to a senior wealth management position? According to Investment News, citing two industry headhunters, former Merrill Lynch brokerage chief Bob McCann and former Citigroup wealth management chief Sallie Krawcheck are both potential candidates for a top wealth management position at UBS. Earlier, the Financial Times reported that UBS's new chief executive, Oswald Gruebel, had decided not to sell the company's wealth management business in the US, despite rumors to the contrary over the past few months due to tax evasion allegations and the subsequent scandal."
"If the outcome of the US presidential election were to be decided by social media, Barack Obama would clearly defeat Republican challenger Mitt Romney next year. The Obama campaign has already embraced social media, with the president having a large following on Facebook and Twitter, and the Democratic National Committee using private social networking tools to communicate with some campaign staff. There is also evidence that the Obama campaign is using social media analytics tools to gauge voter sentiment and track the popularity of campaign messages. Despite attempts to contact both campaigns to discuss their social media strategies, neither responded."
"We should stop defining what impact investing is. Now that they're gone, we can get to work. I've spent the last four years reporting on impact investing as a contributor to Forbes, writing hundreds of articles on the subject. The problem is that most impact investing is only available to the wealthy. This is a guide to impact investing for everyone else, which is to say the 98% of the population who don't qualify to invest alongside the rich."
"The health department has issued another measles warning after a person infected with the disease used public transportation and visited two universities and a supermarket.

"It is expected to be a sunny day today, as a high-pressure system will be established over the weekend. After a cold start, temperatures will rise to 40 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit. It is expected to be cooler tonight under mostly clear skies, with lows ranging from 20 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 30 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Tomorrow, the wind will blow from the south, which means we will see some milder temperatures, with highs expected to reach 50 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit, and even 60 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit in some areas. However, more clouds are expected to form during the day. The clouds seem to thin out at night, with lows ranging from 30 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit and 40 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit."
"It looks like the scene after an earthquake, with orange cardboard boxes scattered all over the floor, shoes stuffed into every gap, and people standing there in a state of shocked stupor. But this is not a natural disaster, just a Black Friday at a Nike factory store in Seattle. The Seattle Premium Outlets in Tulalip, Washington, shared photos and videos after the holiday, showing customers trampling the orange cardboard boxes that were originally used to protect Nike shoes, wandering aimlessly in the store, picking up and discarding sports shoes, presenting a horrific scene."
"The 27th annual Southern Iowa Hot Air Balloon Festival is being held in Creston this weekend. Bill Fastenow, a spokesperson for the Balloon Committee, stated that wind is the key factor in determining whether hot air balloons will take off and in which direction they will fly. Fastenow said that a pilots' meeting will be held at 4:30 this afternoon, followed by a ""Night Glow"" event at the Creston Airport on the south side of town, which he described as a beautiful sight.

"The unemployment rate in Stark County fell to 6.8% in August, the lowest it has been since September 2008. Stark County's unemployment rate has dropped below 7% for the first time, and there are several reasons for the decline. The most likely reason is the oil and gas drilling from the Utica Shale, which has brought a large number of businesses to the area. The first to arrive were the oil exploration companies, followed by engineering and construction companies that provide various services. Manufacturing has also experienced growth due to increased demand for steel and drilling equipment from both local and national sources."
"A horror movie icon will be visiting a haunted attraction in Gaston County on Wednesday and Thursday. Actor Derek Mears, known for his roles in Friday the 13th (2009), Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, Predators, and Men in Black II, will be meeting with horror movie fans at The Haunted Mill in Belmont.

"Washington (United News Agency) - Gold prices remained stable after the Federal Reserve released its latest economic report on Thursday, which indicated that businesses across the United States had become less optimistic over the past few months. Spot gold prices rose 0.2% to $1,294.11 per ounce, while US gold futures remained essentially flat at $1,293.75 per ounce. As the challenges facing the economy intensified, it is expected that the Federal Reserve will at least keep interest rates stable until June. The dollar temporarily stopped rising after its recent gains, while the pound stabilized after British Prime Minister Theresa May won a vote of confidence in Parliament and urged lawmakers to break the Brexit agreement deadlock."
"President Zuma regards the Public Protector's report on state capture as a political tool used to target certain individuals. In an exclusive interview with ANN7 on Monday night, President Zuma shared his views on the report of former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela on state capture. The report recommended that President Zuma appoint a judicial commission of inquiry led by a judge selected by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng to investigate allegations of state capture. The report investigated whether President Zuma's friends, the controversial Gupta family, had undue influence over the government. President Zuma's claim that the report is a political tool has sparked widespread controversy."
"We like it because: few things are more stylish than a good night's sleep. After all, a well-rested night can make you look radiant in the morning - and also feel refreshed. One of the most important factors affecting sleep quality is a good mattress. The new mattress comes in a variety of sizes, from single to California king size, all made of five layers of ""high-end"" foam, including one inch of ""flo"" foam, one and a half inches of latex foam, one and a half inches of memory sponge foam, and one and a half inches of high-elastic foam with supportive gel columns inside."

"When the convention's theme seemed to be ""Drill, baby, drill"", an energy policy that sounds like ""Tax, baby, tax"" - fiscal policy (i.e., it's not), it's clear that this is one of the few things the party has left. If you think increased offshore drilling is going to improve oil exploration and supply, you can't take these people seriously. Unfortunately, yes, you can. Meanwhile, this is the moment when I completely lost interest in the convention."
"The newly appointed chairman of the National Children's Hospital board has said that allowing the hospital's main contractor to exit its role would be a ""bad business decision"". The new chairman, Fred Barry, was speaking at an Oireachtas health committee meeting this morning, where he also stated that the project was undercosted from the start, leading to a massive increase in costs from an estimated €800m in 2014 to €1.73bn now."
"Bob Cannard is turning compost with a shovel at Green String Farm outside of Petaluma, California, on Friday, March 6, 2009. The compost originated from food scraps in San Francisco. As a parent and someone who has worked with parents for years, I was shocked by the front-page story in the El Cerrito edition about the death of a baby (""Baby Dies in Car: A Tragic Lesson for All Parents,"" June 10, 2009). The notion that parents can ""easily forget that a child is left in the back seat"" is, unfortunately, true."
"Southeast Toyota Distributors, LLC (SET) is recalling certain model year 2016 Toyota Yaris, RAV4, Land Cruiser and 4Runner vehicles, as well as Scion FR-S, iM, and TC vehicles, manufactured January 28, 2016, to March 14, 2016.

Consequence: An incorrect label may lead to the vehicle being overloaded, increasing the risk of a crash."
"An attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union today asked a federal appeals court in San Francisco to block a California law that requires police to collect DNA samples from anyone arrested on suspicion of a felony. The law, which was part of a 2004 voter initiative, expanded DNA collection in the criminal justice system through the use of cheek swabs. Four plaintiffs are challenging a provision that took effect in 2009, which requires DNA sampling of anyone arrested on suspicion of a felony, regardless of whether they are charged or convicted of a crime."
"Is it really so? Is the matter really that complicated? According to a report by Green Bay News, the police stated that they would only need two to three weeks to complete the investigation into the alleged sexual assault case involving Brandon Underwood, the tight end player of the Packers team. Underwood was accused by two women from Milwaukee of sexually assaulting them after a charity event at a resort in Lake Delton, Wisconsin. The incident occurred on June 5, and a few days after the incident, police officials indicated that they suspected the incident would not lead to any charges. A major issue is that the women's stories changed, initially involving multiple Packers players, and later only involving Underwood."
"To help determine the Seminole County community's perception of the Seminole County School District, a new logo will be developed from at least one of the top four winning entries from the county logo contest. School board members have stated that they want a new logo because the current logo - a school crossing sign - does not reflect the district's academic achievements. The contest was divided into four age groups: the elementary group for ages 10 and under, the middle school group for ages 11-14, the high school group for ages 15-18, and the adult group for ages 19 and over."
"Los Angeles (AP) - Kings forward Anze Kopitar will undergo surgery on Wednesday to repair a torn ligament caused by a severe ankle sprain in his right foot. An MRI performed on Monday confirmed that the Kings' top scorer will require surgery, which will keep him out of the game indefinitely.

Coach Terry Murray initially stated that the Slovenian all-star had a broken ankle and would be out for at least six weeks, but the Kings ultimately determined it was just a severe high ankle sprain. Kopitar leads the Kings with 25 goals and 43 assists."

Police initially received a report of the incident at 1:10pm. ""There were two incidents in the same area in a short space of time. It appears a truck drove off the road, and then a car and a truck collided."""

"Data released by the Korean Shipbuilders' Association has confirmed the expectations of many analysts: the number of active shipyards around the world has decreased by more than 40% compared to seven years ago. The study defines an active shipyard as one that has at least one ship under construction. According to the association's data, the number of active shipyards in China decreased from 380 to 140, and the number of shipyards in Japan decreased from 70 to 60 during the same period. What's worse, the world's largest shipyards - Daewoo Shipbuilding, Hyundai Heavy Industries, and Samsung Heavy Industries - may have idle space and unused capacity at some point next year."

"Defending champion Victoria Azarenka narrowly defeated injured American Jamie Hampton 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 on Saturday to advance to the fourth round of the Australian Open. Hampton, who was troubled by a lower back problem, often grimaced in pain while serving in the second set and was visibly choked with emotion in the third, but still managed to produce 41 winners to put pressure on the top-ranked Azarenka. Azarenka, who at times looked frustrated, overcame early mistakes and saved three break points in the seventh game to win the match in 2 hours and 9 minutes."
"Suzuki Motor Corporation found that 6,401 out of 12,819 vehicles had undergone improper testing since 2012. In a major blow to the Japanese automaker, Suzuki Motor Corporation announced that the company had been using improper fuel economy and emissions tests in Japan. According to the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism, Suzuki, along with Mazda and Toyota, admitted to cheating in emissions tests and submitting selectively manufactured vehicles in the quality assurance process. Additionally, the samples were tested under inaccurate driving conditions. However, the company is not currently considering recalling these products."
"Brands should resist the temptation to tackle sensitive topics in the Super Bowl in order to grab attention, said Aimee Drolet, a marketing and behavioral decision-making professor at the University of California, Los Angeles' Anderson School of Management: ""Generally, it's not the best place to do these things because the audience is so broad and you're always going to offend half the people,"" she said.

"Searching for ""toxic yeast"" yields hundreds of frightening warnings and ""studies"" with little scientific basis - many driven by economic interests. Recently, one of my patients was hospitalized for alcoholic liver failure. He had a long history of liver disease, but insisted that no one had ever told him to avoid alcohol. Initially, he admitted to only having ""a few drinks"", but as other medical staff questioned him further, his story became more. Despite his liver being in severe shock, he remained stable, and fortunately, most of his liver function was still intact."

As a marketing director for an industry supplier, my day-to-day job is to educate real estate agents. But when I come to Inman Connect, I can learn from them."

"It's safe to say that Cleveland Browns cornerback and Arizona State University alum Damarious Randall didn't anticipate this kind of response. After the Warriors forced the Cleveland Cavaliers into a Game 7 on Monday night, Randall made a guarantee on Twitter: ""If the Cleveland Cavaliers win the 2018 NBA championship I'll buy everyone who retweet's this a jersey."" As of Wednesday afternoon, Randall's tweet had been retweeted over 800,000 times. That's a lot of jerseys - possibly more than Randall can afford."

"Dundee has long been a city of contrasts, with great wealth and extreme poverty. If a new V&A can bring about a turning point, then it will be worth it. I declare my interest. I studied at the University of Dundee, and later spent my final year at the University of St Andrews, and like many people who have been touched by the city, I have a deep affection for it and its people. Not everyone can accept it. At that time, a ""clearing"" scheme sent a large number of last-minute students to the remote Dundee College of Education, where they had hoped to go. Before the opening of the V&A Museum in 2018, Dundee's urban image had been controversial."

"Two groups concerned about mental health care want to know which Vermont doctors received thousands of dollars in gifts from pharmaceutical companies last year. Due to a law protecting trade secrets, pharmaceutical companies can keep some names confidential. The two groups believe this loophole should be closed. Last year, Vermont doctors and other healthcare providers received approximately $3.1 million in gifts from pharmaceutical companies. Vermont is one of the few states that require pharmaceutical companies to disclose such marketing expenses. These payments include consulting fees, travel fees, gifts, and speaking fees.

Therefore, they are calling for the closure of this loophole to make the names of all doctors who receive gifts from pharmaceutical companies publicly transparent. The two groups hope to protect patients' right to health and increase transparency and fairness in the healthcare system through this approach."

Municipal policies vary between Kansas and Missouri."

The latest data collected by the Delray Beach Police Department shows the city had fewer overdose cases in March than in the previous year and in 2016, when the number of overdose cases hit a record high. As the entire country struggles to combat the widespread opioid epidemic, Delray Beach, often referred to as the ""recovery capital,"" has seen a decline in both the number of recovery centers and overdose cases. In March, there were 21 overdose cases, about one-third of the 59 overdose cases reported in March 2017."

"Among all German surface warships, the British feared Bismarck the most. She posed a significant threat to Allied shipping in the Atlantic and had to be sunk. In July 2001, the wreck of Hood was discovered at a depth of 9,334 feet below the surface of the Denmark Strait. It was found to be broken into three parts, with the bow upright, the middle part upside down, and the stern buried deep in the seabed.

"The input text appears to contain a mix of Chinese and English characters and punctuation marks, but due to the chaotic nature of the text, its overall meaning is unclear.

If attempting to extract and translate the recognizable Chinese parts, it may be discovered that:

- "","" translates to ""and""

"Washington - RFK Stadium, once and future home of the capital's Major League Baseball team, is not an ideal venue now. It is configured for soccer, not baseball. The field needs to be changed, the seats, locker rooms, and press box need to be upgraded. Last week, on a rainy day, a quarter of the field was mud and tire tracks. It looked like a place where Vince Lombardi should be coaching football - and he did, for the Washington Redskins in 1969. But that was 1969."
"The millennial generation is not a homogeneous group, so a unified marketing strategy does not work. Millennials want healthy food and are willing to pay more for it. No, wait - millennials are burdened with debt, but still want affordable healthy food. They are also very aware of privilege issues. They are creative and tech-savvy, which is a good thing. And no matter what you do, do not try to reach them through traditional advertising, but rather through social media. All of this sounds familiar because it is just a small part of the many contradictory reports about millennials."

"The events that took place in the UK this week have undoubtedly shocked audiences around the world. The looting and arson have exposed the inner city landscapes of London, Birmingham, and Manchester, an image of England that is usually presented to the outside world through period dramas, Hugh Grant movies, or stories about Prince William and Kate Middleton. If this exposure has left outsiders feeling confused, it has left the British people equally perplexed. The current atmosphere in the UK is a mix of anger, fear, and confusion. It's not that we're unaccustomed to riots; we are. England experienced riots in 1981, the year of the royal wedding."

"Recent research has shown that after inducing Alzheimer's-like symptoms in mice, their cognitive function improved after receiving synthetic estrogen-like hormones. Dr. Christian Pike, associate professor of gerontology at the University of Southern California and leader of the research team, said: ""The way this synthetic hormone improves behavior is similar to estrogen."" However, although estrogen can cause uterine enlargement and is a known risk factor for uterine and breast cancer, PPT did not significantly alter the reproductive tract of the animals. This ""may be a promising strategy to maximize the benefits of hormone therapy while minimizing its risks,"" Pike said."

"Ditching the usual large-scale, over-budget outdoor concerts to promote their latest album, rock band Oasis has begun hiring street performers to do their promotional work for them. Last Friday, a group of street performers gathered to play the band's new songs at various locations in Manhattan. The motley crew included a violinist, guitar players, and of course, some living statues covered in gold paint. They performed in all five boroughs, from subway platforms to park plazas, and even in the pouring rain. Tos and Dominick DePrincipe were among those who got soaked."
"In her weekly therapy sessions, Julie revealed her most uncomfortable secrets: depression, debt, and childhood molestation. Her psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital would enter summaries of this information into Julie's computerized medical records. As a result, more than 200 pages of sensitive notes could be viewed by any doctor who had ever treated her on the shared medical network. Julie didn't find out about this until later, when a doctor mentioned the notes. Julie, a 43-year-old lawyer, initially felt uncomfortable and later became angry. ""These details are nobody's business,"" she said. But Shared Medical disagreed. Julie's psychiatrist would enter these secrets into her computerized medical records, making them available to any doctor who had ever treated her on the shared medical network."
"To truly get the private sector involved in healthcare, there needs to be a significant increase in public sector investment to cover more of the population. The country got a new healthcare policy after 14 years. The long gap in itself indicates the priority, or the lack of it, to an industry that requires immediate attention and is closely linked to the vision of rapid growth and emerging as a strong nation in the global order. The new policy proposed seven key transformations for healthcare institutions, including a shift from selective to comprehensive primary healthcare, which is popular and closely linked to referral hospitals. Additionally, the new policy also emphasizes the importance of preventive healthcare, public health, and healthcare services, as well as the role of health information technology and electronic health records in improving healthcare services."
"The CEO of Vodafone Hutchison Australia, Iñaki Berroeta, is trying to temper expectations for Australia's upcoming 5G network, stating that while the company is pushing ahead with 5G deployment, he does not expect consumer devices to be available until the end of 2019. Berroeta declined to discuss VHA's spectrum ambitions in the Australian 5G space, instead emphasizing the need to establish a new ""ecosystem"" for mobile technology before operators start promoting products. He predicted that when 5G networks are launched, ""most markets"" will see devices become available within one to two months."

He died in 1984 at the age of 80. ""We think Father Ciszek was a very special person who dedicated his life to God and the Church. His experience in the Soviet Union was extremely difficult, but he never gave up his faith. He is a true hero and a role model worth learning from.""

The museum staff hopes that through these exhibitions, more people will learn about Father Ciszek's story and draw inspiration from his life."
"I was just reminded of why I abandoned my career in financial news 11 years ago, including my stint as a reporter on Wall Street. While the financial world has its fascinating aspects, I was disillusioned with the dominant narrative that the financial world is only about money, and not about other considerations such as values and social impact, which seemed to never be taken into account. Given the testosterone-filled trading floors and city executives who are almost completely disconnected from ordinary people, it's not entirely surprising."
"A report to be released on Tuesday will detail how an unknown cyber hacker breached computers in South Carolina and stole tax returns of millions of residents over several years. The report was reported by NBC's Michael Isikoff. In Columbia, South Carolina, last August, staff at the South Carolina Department of Revenue received a malicious email that allowed an international hacker to breach the state's computers and gain access to 3.8 million tax returns, including social security numbers and bank account information. Experts have described it as the largest cyber attack against a state government in history, according to details of the report to be released on Tuesday. The attack was carried out through a phishing email that allowed the hacker to gain access to the state's computer system and steal vast amounts of sensitive information. According to the report, the hacker stole tax returns of millions of residents over several years, including social security numbers and bank account information."
"Syria: Why is Assad's power expanding? The presidential election held in early June declared Assad the winner with 88.7% of the vote. Given the nature of this regime, this is not unexpected. However, despite the fact that these elections are not ""free"" in any sense, and many people, as refugees living abroad, were unable to vote, the results indicate that a large portion of the Syrian people still support Assad. Why is this the case? Stop the criminal attacks on Gaza! Yesterday, the Israeli military launched a ground attack on Gaza."

"BlackBerry Ltd. has decided not to renew a licensing agreement that allows T-Mobile US Inc. to sell its products. A promotional misstep last month strained the relationship between BlackBerry and T-Mobile, despite years of cooperation between the two companies. On Wednesday, BlackBerry announced that it would not renew the licensing agreement, which is set to expire on April 25. In February, T-Mobile offended the Canadian smartphone manufacturer by sending a message to its BlackBerry users offering an iPhone 5s with no upfront cost. The Seattle-based carrier later attempted to mend its relationship with BlackBerry through a second promotion, offering a $200 credit to BlackBerry users when they traded in their old devices for any new T-Mobile phone. BlackBerry stated that the decision would not affect its partnerships with other carriers."
"On November 17, 2015, at 12:55 a.m., Michael Hoppen had to change his habits that he formed in Manhattan. We realized that in Manhattan, the cost was too high for us. We looked everywhere, and finally came to this area, and found the houses to be stunning, and felt great. The owner of the house that was sold to us, Rodney and Desmond, lived next door. They received several offers, and I think they might have preferred us to be their neighbors - a couple expecting a child, wanting to buy their first home. I think that might have been more attractive than paying an extra 0.1% down payment."

"Washington — South Florida has long been one of the most intense battlegrounds in the country, with opponents employing tactics such as creating phantom candidates to siphon off votes from their rivals, or hiring so-called boleteras, or vote brokers, to fill out hundreds of absentee ballots for elderly or disabled voters.

"I want to follow up on a viewer's question because we just started a lively discussion about how to save big bucks. Recently, on GMA Weekend and ABC News Now, I reported on how hiring a medical bill advocate can help you find and fix errors on hospital bills, saving you thousands of dollars. According to the Medical Billing Advocates of America, 80% of hospital bills contain errors. One of the biggest misconceptions about medical billing errors is that most insurance companies pay a fixed fee for hospital stays or surgeries."

Apart from their close relationship with William, the two men had one thing in common: they both wanted to clear his name."
"Where America goes, Britain often follows, and this is particularly true of the negative aspects. If America experiences extreme weather, we usually follow suit a few days later. If America's violent crime rate goes up, so does ours. And then, there's the shopping frenzy. Britain is adopting traditional American events such as post-Christmas sales, bankrupting customers and once again filling them with things they don't need. Black Friday has just passed, today is Cyber Monday, and each shopping day becomes part of the retail calendar on both sides of the Atlantic."

However, the former Marshall Mathers has been a strong contender to star in Anthony Fuqua's boxing drama Southpaw for years, a project that like many others has been stuck in development hell. Now the project has been picked up by the Weinstein Company, and although Eminem is not technically out of the running, he is likely to be replaced soon by some of the biggest stars."

"On the East Coast, voters braved the cold, waiting in the pre-dawn darkness to cast their ballots, marking the end of one of the most grueling and expensive campaigns in U.S. history. They were faced with two starkly different visions for the country's economic recovery. At the Fairlawn Community Center, by 6:00 a.m., over 100 people had already been waiting for more than half an hour, with the polling station set up in the gymnasium in the basement. ""The polls are now open, go vote!"" they were told. They had to make a choice between two men with starkly different ideas for economic recovery."
"As a veteran of the climate change activism movement, I have grown accustomed to disappointment. So, when I was summoned to the office of the Senior Associate Vice President of Stanford University as the coordinator of the Stanford group ""Fossil Free Stanford"", I attended the meeting with some trepidation. My concerns were well-founded. Just that morning, Harvard University had arrested a student for demanding a public discussion on fossil fuel divestment. The previous fall, Brown University had flatly rejected student demands to divest from the thirteen dirtiest coal companies. Efforts to implement climate policies at the national and international levels had fared no better."

"Don Draper: Who's crying now? Last month, when Jon Hamm hosted Saturday Night Live, his monologue told the story of his supposed pre-Mad Men career, featuring clips of him in various roles - all of which looked and sounded like a typical, über-confident 1960s ad man Don Draper - including a QVC host and a Def Comedy Jam comedian.

"The airline operates 744 mainline aircraft, ranging in size from 50 to 366 seats. For a typical 737 aircraft carrying 179 passengers, this weight-saving measure means a reduction of about 11 pounds per flight.

This implies that United Airlines earned less than $2.3 million in revenue from selling these items on planes, or that allowing passengers to purchase these items on the ground would not have a significant impact on its revenue."

"The controversy between US intelligence agencies and their elected President Donald Trump is not only confusing, but also a special case for evaluating the principles that should guide the relationship between national intelligence and political administration under a democratic system. In theory, an intelligence-based national security system is responsible for detecting and tracking any national security threats, whether external or internal, and is committed to eliminating them. However, it operates under the authorization of an elected political administration, which is the highest sovereign power. Under a democratic system, the political administration is the ultimate embodiment and representative of national sovereignty. Therefore, the relationship between the national security system and the political administration is complex and subtle, requiring a balance to be struck to ensure that the national security system can effectively fulfill its duties while also being supervised and constrained by the political administration. This balance is crucial for ensuring the effectiveness of the national security system and the healthy operation of the democratic system. The controversy between US intelligence agencies and President Trump highlights the importance of this balance and the complexity of the relationship between the national security system and the political administration under a democratic system."

According to an analysis by the Consumer Federation of America (CFA) on Tuesday, millions of Americans have defaulted on their student loan repayments. Data obtained by the US Department of Education shows that as of the end of 2016, 42 million people in the US owed $1.3 trillion in federal student loans, with the average debt per borrower increasing by 17% since 2013.

Ameen sent the emails in February and March, when Senate Republican leaders insisted that complaints of sexual misconduct and workplace harassment against lawmakers should be kept confidential under the legislature's workplace harassment policy, or handled by prosecutors."
"It was a Saturday morning in August, I remember it very clearly. I was online, sitting on my bed, browsing the web aimlessly. An article caught my attention: it was about the refugee crisis. Men, women, and children were risking their lives to get to Western Europe, with many losing their lives along the way. It was a story of resilience and traumatic horror. I had expected to see sympathy and compassion, but as I read the comments, my heart sank. They were filled with cruelty."
"Central American referee Carlos Batres put on the worst acting performance in the World Cup, which is saying something for an Italian, being only second to Federico Fellini, thus depriving the New Zealand All Whites of a historic win against the current football world champions. This brings back memories of the 2006 World Cup match between Australia and Italy, where Italy won the match in stoppage time with a man advantage after Fabio Grosso dove on Lucas Neill's defense. In short, four-time World Cup winners Italy cheated their way back into the game."

"He wore jeans, was slender, and had an aura about him. Many fans think the nickname was an unfortunate byproduct of his success at the time. On Tuesday, November 14, the real Rambo visited Springsteen backstage after ""Springsteen on Broadway"".

"Over the past five years, the internet has undergone changes beyond people's expectations. It is no longer just a medium for browsing: it is filled with Web 2.0 applications, real-time communication challenges, and various threats that aim to take advantage of this new way of use. As a result, network security has undergone incredible changes - simply blocking, stopping, or suppressing IP sessions is no longer enough. Network filtering is unable to cope with the security challenges. This webinar will explain the changes in the way the internet is used, and how your understanding of IT may not match the actual behavior of users, resulting in your security controls being bypassed."
"The fourth episode of ""The Newsroom"", ""I'll Try to Change Your Mind"", can also be seen as the title for the entire series. Similar to Sorkin's ""The West Wing"", the show attempts to change America through the story of Will McAvoy, a successful, cynical, and apathetic cable news anchor who decides that he, the news, and the democratic system can all do better. What does this mean? Will's producer and ex-girlfriend Mackenzie McHale explains: ""Take back the fourth estate"". The phrase refers to the news media as the fourth pillar, a watchdog of the government and a provider of accurate information to the public, and Mackenzie hopes that Will can reclaim this function of the news media by reporting real news and thought-provoking commentary, thereby changing America."

"My daughter, who is a resident advisor at her university, recently mentioned that she may be getting more international exchange students in the fall and seemed a bit complaining about it. When I asked her why that was a bad thing, she said international exchange students tend to think Americans are stupid unless they prove otherwise. They think Americans don't travel as widely as they do, aren't as fluent in foreign languages as they are, and aren't as knowledgeable about world culture. I said what any good American would say: why don't they just stay home then? Oh, she replied, it's not that they think our universities are stupid."

Arizona has approved all necessary health professional licensures to provide patients with a comprehensive approach to addressing chronic pain.

According to the law, registered practitioners can only legally perform abortions in New Zealand after obtaining a certificate from two certifying consultants appointed by the Abortion Supervisory Committee. The appeal also argues that the court made an error of law in believing that the committee can form its own opinion on the legality of certifying consultants approving or declining abortions."

"Ricky Karlgaard: You should be focused on four areas. One is financial regulation, which still makes it hard for small businesses to get loans. You mentioned healthcare regulation, Obamacare increased the cost burden in many ways. Then there's environmental regulation, which is a broad area that's suffocating small businesses, especially in California where I live. California farmers are being crushed, supposedly to protect certain insects. And then you have labor regulation. Last year, we saw the National Labor Relations Board take action against Boeing."

"Can our faith be measured by price? The question is being posed by believers as the tradition of tithing - donating 10% of one's income to the church - is increasingly being challenged. Opponents of tithing argue that it is a misinterpretation of the Bible, a human creation rather than God's will. They believe that there should be freedom to choose the amount to donate, and are therefore arguing with pastors, writing letters, and even protesting by leaving the church. In response, some pastors are changing their teachings, abandoning the most popular fundraising method of the past few decades."

"Several bills in the New Jersey legislature have caught the attention of the state's truck drivers and other road users. Repeat drunk drivers may soon face stiffer penalties. Currently, New Jersey law classifies punishment for affected offenders only as a traffic violation, with bail typically set at $2,500. Classification as a traffic violation allows drivers charged with drunk driving to continue driving while waiting for their court date. A pending state legislative bill aims to put an end to this practice. Instead, A3057 would increase penalties for individuals convicted of drunk driving two or more times within 60 days, designating it as a fourth-degree crime."

"The Bible teaches us to ""resist the devil and he will flee from you"" (James 4:7), and also tells us to stay away from those who are controlled by all kinds of evil desires (see 1 Timothy 3:5-6). In God's eyes, many great leaders have fallen into the temptations of the flesh, possibly ruining their lives and ministries. Someone said, ""It takes a lifetime to build a reputation, but only a minute to lose it."" This is a true statement! I believe one of the main reasons leaders fall is that most of them have never consciously built a firewall in their minds and emotions."

In a recent lawsuit, the heirs of the composer of the song ""Taurus"" claimed that ""Stairway to Heaven"" infringed on copyright law. Creators have been borrowing from each other for centuries. But what is the real harm - economic, artistic, or otherwise? How much of the original work is transplanted into the new work? It's always a gray area. Music copyright lawsuits have been going on for over a century."
"A detailed upgrade process, I hope that if you didn't have such experience before, this will be helpful to you. Let me be in charge of removing the screws at the back, being careful with the keyboard sliding connection to the blue connector, and gently taking it off.

Ken Block's Gymkhana Nine was filmed to coincide with the release of the video game Forza Horizon 3, which is set in Australia - so it made sense to film Gymkhana Nine in Australia."

"The photographs of Yemen we publish are among the most disturbing we have ever published. Here is why we decided to publish them. In our recent coverage of Yemen, a 7-year-old Yemeni girl, Amal Hussein, appeared before us, her gaze shocking, from a country on the brink of war and famine.

"January 29, 2015: Follow the money. One reason the new peace talks are making progress is that the factions controlling most of the population are willing to make concessions to help halt the rapid decline in the standard of living nationwide. If the decline can be halted, the factions are willing to make concessions. The fighting between factions, especially between the two governments that claim to rule the entire country, has led to a shrinkage of economic activity and an increase in shortages. Then, there is the violence from Islamic terrorism. While most Libyans are grateful for the help Islamic terrorists provided in 2011 to overthrow Kaddafi, since then these groups have become a greater curse than Kaddafi's secret police."
"The fundamental difference between humans and machines lies in two key aspects: creativity and empathy. Regardless of how advanced artificial intelligence becomes, these two aspects are the reasons why agency services will continue to exist and why marketers will remain busy in the coming years. The purpose of AI is to be a supplement to your work, enhancing your capabilities. AI can bring a level of efficiency to companies that they previously lacked, and give them more time to complete those incremental tasks. Agency companies were successful in the past because they were creative."

One of the core actions of the program was to provide free school meals to poor children, which were purchased by the government from family farms.

The program also provided cash transfers and vocational training to poor families, further improving their standard of living.

"The head of the United Nations fact-finding mission on the Gaza conflict, Judge Richard Goldstone, urged the international community to take action to end the impunity of Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory for violations of international law, as he presented the mission's report to the Human Rights Council.

"The primary task of the North Korean Minister of Lightweight Affairs was to refute every statement ever made by a French intellectual. In one year, he particularly targeted Jean-Paul Sartre, first countering Sartre's assertion that ""three o'clock is always too early or too late for anything you want to do"". As it was a leisurely Friday afternoon, the Minister of Lightweight Affairs simply made a phone call and named his local football team 4:25 PM Sports Club. This made Sartre look absurd, as all of the team's matches started at 4:25 PM. In fact, whenever they played, their fans would chant ""Sartre, are you watching?"""
