Over the past 100 years, the Espionage Act has been used to prosecute those who expose government wrongdoing, rather than spies. This has created a culture of fear and silence, as whistleblowers face severe legal consequences for speaking out. To put an end to this, we must revise the Act to clearly distinguish between espionage and whistleblowing. We must also establish stronger safeguards for whistleblowers, including the right to public interest defense. This will ensure protection for those who expose corruption and abuse, rather than prosecuting them."

This policy disproportionately affects the elderly and those approaching retirement, who heavily rely on the interest from these accounts. The lack of substantial income from savings fuels a sense of financial insecurity among savers."
"When George Orwell wrote ""1984"", he incorporated into it a vision of the future in which people would communicate in a language known as ""Newspeak"". This dialect was designed to limit free thought and self-expression, as the government manipulated language to control its citizens. Today, Orwell's vision seems eerily prophetic. With the rise of social media and political correctness, the way we communicate is increasingly regulated and censored. Orwell's dystopian future serves as a stark warning to us to preserve the richness and freedom of our language and to resist any attempt to restrict or control it."
