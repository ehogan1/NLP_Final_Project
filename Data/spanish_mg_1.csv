Pollard argues that these measures could potentially save Texas millions of dollars in the long run."

"Do you want to end the war on whistleblowers? Review the Espionage Act. For the last 100 years, the Espionage Act has been used to prosecute those who expose government wrongdoing, rather than spies. This has created a culture of fear and silence, as whistleblowers face severe legal consequences for speaking out. To end this, we must review the Act to clearly distinguish between espionage and whistleblowing. We must also establish stronger protections for whistleblowers, including the right to a public interest defense. This would ensure that those who expose corruption and abuse are protected, not persecuted."

Creativity and empathy stem from a depth of human experience that cannot be artificially replicated. Machines are tools that can help us, but they will never replace human capacity for imaginative thinking and emotional connection."
