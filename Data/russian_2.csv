"The girl on the threshold returns, and our main characters are in very interesting relationships. Cecilia and Schmidt have finally tied the knot. Nick is in a relatively new romance with Reagan, and Winston is actually dating Eli. So, what can we expect? Here are six things that excite us the most about this season. 1. We will see more of Reagan. If you enjoyed Megan Fox's appearance in the show ""The Girl"" last season, then you should be happy that she's back."

"As part of the LifeMedGreenRoof project, the Standards Directorate within the Maltese Competition and Consumer Affairs Authority (MCCAA) held its second stakeholder meeting to launch public consultations on a national standard for green roofs. Under the EU's 2020 strategy, which aims to reduce energy consumption by at least 20 percent by 2020, the European Commission's 2011 Energy Efficiency Plan identified buildings as having the greatest potential for energy savings. The plan focuses on mechanisms to reduce energy consumption in existing buildings - particularly in public buildings - and the role of projects in promoting energy efficiency measures."
"Voter fraud has been confirmed in several states, including Mississippi. Louisiana's top election official is warning residents about potential scams aimed at getting their personal information after similar problems in several other states. The scam involves the caller claiming to work for a voter registration organization. The callers offer to register residents over the phone, and in some cases, send the voter a mail-in ballot, said Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin. According to state law, residents cannot register to vote or request a mail-in ballot over the phone."
"For small businesses that sell on credit, accounts receivable can make up a significant portion of the balance sheet. During the annual audit, auditors will verify that you can substantiate your accounts receivable balance claims. These claims are known as assertions. The most common audit procedure related to accounts receivable is confirmation, where the auditor will ask your customers to confirm their account balance. Knowing which assertions can be proven through confirmation can help you understand why your auditor requires several audit procedures for the same account. Accounts receivable confirmations are primarily used to prove the existence assertion."
"Rejoice that you're not Jim Furyk today. 1. The American team came out on Sunday with a huge four-point advantage in the Ryder Cup, and the local fans expected to have another dominant day. 2. Luke Donald won the first match of the day against Bubba Watson, making the score 10-7. Nevertheless, the US has a big advantage. However. 3. Paul Lawrie from Europe completely outplayed Brandt Snedeker, earning another point for Europe. 4. At least Keegan Bradley, the best player on the American team all weekend, was showing good fight against Rory McIlroy."
"It happens: you hit the snooze button once, twice, and then three times, so by the time you finally take a shower, get dressed, and are ready to tackle the day, you're already running behind schedule. Often, this causes you to skip breakfast altogether. It turns out that your breakfast habit is one of the time-saving steps that shouldn't be skipped. Firstly, consuming a nutritious, high-protein, and balanced breakfast every morning is a proven way to kick-start your brain, improving concentration and productivity. Additionally, breakfast is associated with better weight control, as it provides your body with energy and can reduce hunger later in the day."
"Dublin: Lawmakers voted overwhelmingly on Friday to support Ireland's first abortion bill, legalizing the practice in exceptional cases where doctors deem a woman's life to be at risk due to her pregnancy, thus making the country's first legislative step away from a total ban with its predominantly Catholic population. Weary lawmakers applauded the Friday vote of 127-31, while outside the parliament gates, abortion rights activists cheered, watching the result on their smartphones. This marked the culmination of grueling debates that pitted lawmakers from Wednesday morning until 5 am Thursday and, after a sleep break, until midnight Friday."
"The best Halloween costumes are inspired by the most memorable moments of the year, and 2016 was no exception. We had the Summer Olympics and the US presidential election, which take over the front pages of newspapers (and Facebook feeds!) every four years. Add to that Beyoncé's visually stunning album, the Pokémon Go craze, and the colorful, quotable madness of the movie ""Suicide Squad"", and 2016 was practically begging for a Halloween costume boom. We've become experts in all things Halloween - producing content that's been viewed over a billion times. That's where we come in."

"VOLGOGRAD/GELENDZHIK, Russia (Reuters) - Iceland will try not to melt in the heat of Volgograd when they play Nigeria in their only second World Cup match on Friday after impressively drawing with twice champions Argentina over the weekend. World Cup debutants Iceland are dreaming of the knockout stage and writing a new chapter in one of the most remarkable stories in international football in recent years. Standing in their way is not only Nigeria, who desperately need a win after losing their first match to Croatia 2-0, but also the challenge of the heat in the southern Russian city."
"Two thieves from Metro Vancouver have been arrested and charged after allegedly committing a long series of mail thefts and identity-related crimes. After the Royal Canadian Mounted Police from Coquitlam and Canada Post inspectors worked together on the investigation into mail theft, investigators identified the main suspect, made arrests, and used search warrants to seize a large amount of evidence, according to a November 11 press release from the Coquitlam Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Hai Ne Hat, a 49-year-old Surrey resident well known to police, is facing six charges, including mail theft, unauthorized use of a postal key, as well as possession of stolen mail and a stolen credit card."
"First, we looked at which major brands are the most expensive to maintain over the first 10 years of a vehicle's life. We grouped all model years by brand to calculate the average cost by brand. To estimate annual maintenance costs, we identified the amount spent on every other oil change (since oil changes are typically done every six months). German imports, perhaps not surprisingly, top the list by a wide margin. Toyota and its two brands, Lexus and Scion, are among the cheapest, saving owners at least $10,000 over ten years compared to BMW."

"Veteran Congressman Jim Leach (R-Iowa) was defeated in the 2006 bloodbath. I am not a defender of ""moderate Republicans,"" but it's worth saying that Leach, in my opinion, was obviously the best Republican in the House. Nevertheless, one can only rejoice at his defeat. The fact that it happened only shows how fundamentally rotten the entire Republican party apparatus has become. Leach was, in many ways, a man with genuinely decent instincts and some fundamentally correct ideas about how the US should conduct itself in the world. Nevertheless, in practice, he was useless."
"Donald Trump's tweets have long raised questions about whether they violate Twitter's rules prohibiting abusive behavior on the service. On Monday, after a Trump tweet threatened that North Korea ""won't be around much longer"", Twitter was forced to explain why the president wasn't blocked from the service. In a six-tweet statement from Twitter's public policy account, the company said that Twitter takes into account ""newsworthiness"" and ""public interest"" when determining whether a user has violated its rules. These factors have long been used internally by the company when deciding the fate of a problematic user, Twitter said."
"No one can predict with certainty when the stock markets will end their record bull run. But the best way for investors to cope with a future downturn is to remain calm and stick to a well-thought-out plan. The Star asked Ellie Fienstein Gerstl, author of the book ""30-Day Financial Detox: Take Control of Your Money, Manage Your Expenses and Get Rid of Financial Stress Forever"", about why people find it so hard to manage their own finances - and how they can do it better. There are also other common expenses that people often overlook or accidentally misreport."
"After the first two months of the year went largely according to plan, Summit County real estate sales experienced a slump in March, leading to a notable downturn in first-quarter numbers, according to data from Slifer Smith & Frampton.

Council members will meet twice during the school year with State Superintendent Dr. Tommy Bice."
"South Bend (IN) -- On Thursday morning, the Irish took to the practice field for the final time before Saturday's Blue-Gold game. One of the biggest questions the team faced entering spring practice remains unanswered: who will replace the linebacker? Defensive coordinator Clark Lea said that fifth-year linebacker Asmar Bilal is currently the closest to being ""absolute"" in the unit, but he seems to agree with the uncertainty. He believes the position has made big strides over the past month and a half, but is in no rush to have everything in place, as the first week of the season is still several months away."
"This month, Drake wrapped up his residency at the O2 Arena in London. But he wasn't ready to fly back across the ocean and go home just yet. Instead, over the weekend, he joined Tiffany Calver, host of a rap show on BBC 1Xtra, and became her co-host for the day. While he was there, he talked about a multitude of things. He reminisced about the early days of his career and even commented on rumors that he's a culture vulture because he appropriates British and Caribbean cultures. But the most interesting thing, well, at least for us Africans, was his admiration for Niniola."

"It's hard to overstate Amazon's success and growing power. Their market capitalization is hovering just below $1 trillion. Their growth rates have been stunning. By most estimates, Amazon now accounts for nearly 50% of all US e-commerce sales, about 5% of all retail sales, and significantly more than their next 10 competitors combined. One study shows that about 55% of all online product searches start on Amazon. This week's report that Amazon is considering opening as many as 3,000 of its cashierless Amazon Go stores by 2021 drew a lot of attention, despite having opened only its fourth location just a few days ago."
"NEW YORK — The lawyer who went on a tirade against employees at a Spanish-language restaurant in New York apologized on Tuesday. ""To those people I offended, I apologize. Seeing myself on the internet, I opened my eyes — the way I expressed myself is inexcusable and is not the person I am. I see that my words and actions hurt people, and for that, I deeply regret it. Although people should have the freedom to express themselves, they should do so calmly and with respect. What the video did not convey is the real me. I am not a racist."
"Some apps strive to change the world, while others are designed to bring beauty to your pocket gadget. Beautiful Clock Widgets falls into the latter category. This small Android app does exactly what it says on the label, offering a collection of clock widgets with the option to add additional data such as local weather and battery charge information. Some of them are cool, others are funny, and a few are just weird. It's worth noting that some of them are only available in the Pro version, which costs $1.26 or the equivalent amount in your local currency."

"It is not uncommon for us to read and hear complaints about the amount of waste used by the two main parties, a phenomenon that seems to intensify during election campaigns. And yet, rarely do these two parties actively strive for genuine waste. And by that, I mean a discussion about waste in the literal sense! And yet, the issue of waste and garbage in general is one that affects us all, touching on issues of public health, social cohesion, and tourism, among other things!"
"The city of Zamboanga - Horror has gripped the residents of Pata Island in Sulu, and it does not come from extremists, but from politicians. The residents have sought help from the government to prevent another attack on their island community, which, according to one of them, was provoked by the residents' refusal to support the incumbent mayor, Anton Buruhan. ""We are helpless,"" said 60-year-old Bidin Jubail, a resident of Saimbangan, one of the villages on Pata Island.

"The life of the mind puzzles poets and neurobiologists who map it and assign labels to it, and in my case, try to find it. The very thought of it is worth pondering in the Irish tradition, and therefore there are many concepts in the Irish language related to the mind, dreams, and imagination. I am just a student, so many nuances will escape me, but language is conversation. I would love to hear how native speakers propose more complex thoughts about the lexicon of Irish thought."
"According to analysts, the market is entering a consolidation phase after the recent rally. NEW DELHI: The below-normal monsoon forecast by private weather agency Skymet proved to be a big disappointment for the stock indices on Wednesday, which gave up their gains after hitting absolute highs.

Supervisor Sheila Kuehl stated that more of the county's 10 million residents should be allowed to weigh in on the matter."

"Ottawa, March 20 (Reuters) - In the latest blow to the government of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a lawmaker quit the ruling Liberal Party to sit as an independent on Wednesday after defending a former minister at the center of a political scandal. Trudeau has been on the defensive since February 7 over allegations that top officials working for him pressured former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to ensure that construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoided a trial on corruption charges.

"The Grant Bar and Grill is a lively spot where local musicians play on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evenings, as well as Sundays during lunch on the outdoor patio. If the Old Fish House could talk, just imagine the fascinating stories it would tell about 100 years of life by the Indian River Lagoon. It could tell us about the early days when entire families slept on their fishing boats. We would hear tales of the morning light on the river, when the husbands took the same boats and joined the fishing fleet heading out to sea, while the families stayed behind with the wives who worked tirelessly in the fish house, processing the fish."

"Maureen Wildes claims it's time to learn about the true impact of the Vietnam War on the children of veterans. Like many other children of veterans, I am also a statistic.

Hello, I am the wife of a Vietnam veteran, I have three children. My first daughter from my first marriage when I was 18, and the next two girls from my second marriage in 1970."

"Less than two years ago I was at a South Atlantic League (Low A ball) game between the Hagerstown Suns and the visiting Greensboro Grasshoppers. Sitting behind me were two Greensboro pitchers - Trevor Richards and Ben Meyer. They were keeping a scorecard of the game. As I mentioned in this post, neither of the pitchers seemed destined for the big leagues. Richards wasn't drafted in 2015 after completing a small college, so he had to start his career with the Gateway Grizzlies of the Frontier League, which is an independent league. The Miami Marlins signed him in 2016, and he did well for Greensboro."
"The United Nations, August 26 - Amid an intensifying propaganda campaign predicting US missile strikes on Syria, regardless of what the UN chemical weapons team finds in the suburbs of Damascus, the question arises whether these strikes will be carried out while the UN team is still in the country.

What does the UN hope to find as a result of this investigation? What actions is the UN willing to take?"

"Without a doubt, the addiction drama ""Beautiful Boy"" - not the horror film ""Halloween"" - is the most disturbing movie opening this weekend. Starring Steve Carell (""Foxcatcher"") and Timothée Chalamet (""Call Me By Your Name""), the film is a haunting and harrowing look at a young man's descent into methamphetamine addiction (and heroin, pills, marijuana, etc.) and the efforts of a devoted father trying to save him. It's a true and terrifying story, so powerful that even an uninspired director and clichéd script can't diminish its impact."

Every person has a busy life, but if you have recently moved a loved one into a nursing home or memory cottage, it is even more important to stay in touch with them. Nutrition is important in every person's life, but especially in the elderly."

Donald Trump and Megyn Kelly, who for much of the election cycle had publicly feuded, privately seethed at or ignored each other, met at Trump Tower on Monday, apparently putting an end to the silence between them. ""Yes, the Swiss, it seemed, were a little taken aback when I walked in,"" Kelly said on her Fox News program on Wednesday evening."
"Navy builders from Naval Mobile Construction Battalion (NMCB) 7 and members of Alpha Company, 427th Brigade Combat Team, stand in formation during a transfer of authority ceremony at Camp Moreell, Southwest Asia, May 23. The Navy builders operated Camp Moreell, named after Admiral Ben Moreell, the ""Father of the Seabees,"" for nearly 10 years as their main base and assembly point for many sailors who were deployed to serve in Southwest Asia before turning over their duties to the Army. The main hub for deploying ""Seabees"" to Iraq and Afghanistan and back was closed during a ceremony held at Ali Al Salem Air Base, Kuwait, May 23."
"The University of Sri Jayewardenepura marked 60 years of excellence in higher education on 18 February 2019, reaching a significant milestone in its historic journey.

The University of Sri Jayewardenepura's rich and vibrant history - initially as the Vidyodaya Pirivena - dates back to 1873."
"Magic is the best way to describe the Rugby Academy of the Litton High School Hurricanes' championship win in Levin. In only the second year of the academy's existence, the under-15 girls' team, led by coach Trish Hina, defeated Wanganui 66-0, Feilding 42-0, and Kapiti 49-0 on the first day. On the second day, they defeated a combined Wairarapa-Bush team 61-0 and Mana College 73-5, before thrashing Feilding 63-10 in the final. The Litton team is a cohesive unit, and over six games, they conceded just three tries. ""The girls have worked extremely hard to get to where they are now,"" said Hina, a former Black Ferns rugby player for New Zealand."
"Vodafone has announced changes to its data roaming tariffs. These changes will benefit those who use less than 5MB of data per day while abroad. From June 15, the daily network rate in Europe will be £1 per megabyte for the first 5MB, and then £5 for every subsequent 5MB. Outside of Europe, the rate will be £3 per megabyte for the first 5MB, and then £15 for every subsequent 5MB. These changes will benefit those with minimal data requirements, but those who need constant internet access will pay more for the privilege."
"PREBLE COUNTY — Following two serious crashes involving young people in Preble County over the past week, Preble County Sheriff Mike Simpson discussed summer driving issues as younger, less experienced drivers become more active on the roads during the summer months. According to Simpson, roads often become more crowded in the summer, and younger drivers are more frequently on the roads since they are not in school. ""When kids are not in school or are coming home from college, there are a lot more young drivers on the road driving back and forth to events or to work, since they are no longer spending 6-7 hours a day in school,"" Simpson said."
"Relatives of the deceased bravely listened as the circumstances of the death were revealed. Frustrating details about how the helicopter crash victims at Clutha died were limited at today's fatal accident inquiry. This came in a joint minute of agreement - a legal mechanism that means the prosecution and the other 14 legal parties to the inquiry will not contest the details. Gary Arthur, 48, a sales consultant, was found in the pub, pinned under debris. He had no pulse when he was found by paramedics. A post-mortem examination revealed that he died from head injuries."
"The state's Correctional Punishment Commission unanimously voted at a special meeting this morning to appoint interim director Kevin Murphy as the permanent head of the Department of Correctional Facilities. His existing salary of $123,380 will remain unchanged. Murphy was put in charge after Governor Asa Hutchinson fired Shelia Sharp due to questions about the state agency's adequacy of parole and behavioral supervision. Murphy has a complicated history in the position, having at one point had a contract paid for by a non-profit organization working on behalf of agency employees, and also receiving a Department of Correctional Facilities pension."
"Californians, more than anyone else, should understand what it means to displace people from their land. In the 1850s and 1860s, the state funded annual expeditions that devastated entire areas of Native American presence. But this is not just a historical phenomenon: On the West Bank, Israeli settlers and the Israeli government have been trying for decades to eradicate the small Palestinian village of Susya. The village has existed near Hebron at least since the 19th century. In the 1980s, it was declared an archaeological site to allow settlers to settle and replace the former inhabitants."
"Speaker Nabih Berri and the Syrian ambassador to Lebanon on Friday discussed the ""Israeli-Western schemes"" in the Syrian civil war, Berri's office reported. The Lebanese army set up a cordon on Friday in preparation for the destruction of an old arsenal found in the Siniq area of Sidon. Lebanese workers staged 28 strikes and 121 protests in 2018, including strikes at the state-owned electricity company Electricite Du Liban and at the Lebanese University, a human rights monitor reported on Friday. An Iranian citizen was arrested in Beirut on charges of human trafficking and forging official documents, the Asharq al-Awsat newspaper reported on Friday."
"Every year, the police and state authorities ensure that Bangaloreans are warned in advance before Diwali to be safe. However, as in previous years, more than 60 firecracker-related injuries have already been reported in the city this year. Shockingly, this year children between the ages of 4 and 14 have suffered eye injuries due to disregard for fire safety measures. The city has been filled with a festive atmosphere since Monday, but the city's hospitals collectively have admitted 60 firecracker victims. Additionally, starting from yesterday, local clinics in several residential areas have been attending to patients every hour."
"Bhubaneswar: Sashi Bhusan Behera, Minister of Finance and Excise, hopes that IOCL will participate in Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) created for the development of PCPIR in Paradip, as well as in the Plastic Park in Paradip through equity participation. In addition, IOCL needs to develop an attractive pricing mechanism for raw materials to encourage the creation of production units in Paradip. The state government has also approached the Ministry of Chemicals and Petrochemicals, Government of India, to provide budgetary support of at least 3000 crore rupees for carrying out necessary infrastructure development works in the region, said Shri Behera."
"A popular Belgian waffle franchise has opened in Dubai with the support of the state agency for small and medium-sized businesses. The Yummy Waffles cafe opened in Dubai Festival City on Sunday as part of a franchising agreement with Dubai SME, an agency of the Department of Economic Development responsible for the development of small and medium-sized businesses. The cafe is part of the So Good Company franchise, most famous for its waffle mix, and already has stores all over Europe, North America, South Africa, Turkey, Hong Kong, and mainland China.

Avid's bins have been overhauled, and the software is now equipped with task-based workspaces that display only the elements the user will need to perform a specific task."
"A cancer expert has found a way to kill tumors in just two hours - using light. The method involves a one-time introduction of a chemical substance, followed by a burst of ultraviolet radiation. It has been found that cancer cells in laboratory mice self-destruct, with up to 95 percent of cells dying within two hours. Professor Matthew Gdovin revealed that the cells he introduced with the chemical compound nitrobenzaldehyde became too acidic to survive. He said after patenting his ""photodynamic"" therapy: ""There are many different types of cancer. One thing they have in common is their susceptibility to this induced cell suicide."""
"Drones are released today in a wide variety of forms and sizes, but speaking in general, most of them still belong to one of two categories. There are those that belong to the type of multi-rotors (quadcopters, hexacopters, octacopters, etc.), and those that belong to the type of winged ones. Each category has its own advantages and disadvantages. Multi-rotor aircraft are usually more stable and easier to control, but also much slower than winged drones, which are focused on accelerating forward. On the other hand, winged drones can fly faster and farther than their hovering counterparts, but are more difficult to pilot, as they cannot perform vertical takeoffs and landings."
"BASEL, Switzerland – Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche Holding AG said on Monday it had received reports of 13 cases in which the H1N1 flu virus had become resistant to its drug Tamiflu, which it considered a very low percentage. A good sign was that people with the resistant form did not pass the disease on to others, said David Reddy, the head of Roche's Tamiflu pandemic taskforce. And the resistant variant was similar to the widely circulating version of the virus in that it usually caused only mild symptoms. The 13 cases were scattered around the world in Europe, the US, and Asia, Reddy said."
"Russian President Vladimir Putin called the downing of a Russian fighter jet by Turkish military today (November 24) ""a stab in the back by the accomplices of terrorists"", stating that the incident will have serious consequences. Speaking at the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi on Tuesday before a meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah, Putin said the downed plane was attacked over Syria when it was just 1 kilometer from the Turkish border and crashed 4 kilometers inside Syria. This contradicts Turkey's statement that the plane was warned several times that it had entered Turkish airspace before it was shot down."
"Arsene Wenger believes the return to training of English forward Theo Walcott and the impending recovery of German player Lukas Podolski means that Arsenal are not under additional pressure to buy another striker in January. The Gunners resume domestic matches on Saturday, seeking to respond to a 1-0 defeat by Manchester United with a win over third-placed Southampton to stay top of the Barclays Premier League. Walcott is likely to play against his former club after approximately two months out with a stomach problem that required surgery. Podolski, meanwhile, is on course to be available again by the end of December after not playing since 27 August due to a hamstring injury."
"The New York Knicks are approaching the quarter mark of the calendar with a mediocre 9-9 record, seeking to end a 43-year championship drought. Coach Jeff Hornacek and the Knicks will have the upper hand against opponents in December. Of the 15 games they will play this month, only five will be against teams with a positive record. They will host the 5-13 Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday. Joakim Noah, Derrick Rose, and Carmelo Anthony may be the most notable names on the roster, but they are not performing up to expectations. Anthony's team-leading average of 22.2 points per game is slightly higher than last season."
"The Hashimite Library remained a beacon of knowledge and a destination for readers and intellectuals until 2000, when the number of readers began to decline due to the difficult economic situation in the Gaza Strip. In the 1950s, the Hashimite Library received an order to sell newspapers and books from renowned Egyptian publishing houses and distributors. It was also a space for writers and intellectuals to meet. However, the invasion of the Internet and the poverty of the residents of the Gaza Strip hindered these activities. ""Due to the rise of the Internet and economic stagnation, we no longer received books for distribution or sale."
"Google has long had strained relations with China, and the search giant largely abandoned the Chinese market after it said state-backed hackers had targeted the company's systems and employees. An upcoming book by chairman Eric Schmidt, ""The New Digital Age"", is unlikely to improve the situation, judging by a description of the work in the Wall Street Journal, which has seen galleys of the not-yet-released book. ""...in this global internet, China, as the book repeatedly asserts, is the most dangerous and threatening superpower,"" Tom Gara writes."
"Ray Trew has stepped down as chairman of Notts County and announced the League Two club is up for sale. Trew became owner and chairman in 2010, but said he had made the decision after his family had been subjected to ""vile and mindless abuse"" in recent days. Notts, who appointed Jamie Fullarton as manager in January, are 16th in League Two, having been relegated from the top division last season. According to BBC Radio Nottingham, local businessman Alan Hardy is in talks to buy the club. ""With very mixed emotions I announce the end of my tenure,"" Trew wrote in an open letter to fans."
"Warning: the video above contains graphic images. SODUS, N.Y. (WHEC) -- A new management team promised changes, but complaints about care and conditions inside the Sodus Rehabilitation and Nursing Center continue to pour in. News10NBC has been investigating the facility and its reputation for more than a year, and although leadership was replaced last summer, families continue to face serious safety concerns inside. Joy Ann Mitchell-Kinley was under the care of Father Bill Tanner, as her father and Bill Tanner were best friends, and when her father passed away, Bill took Joy Ann under his wing."
"Do you want to put an end to the war on whistleblowers? Revise the Espionage Act. Over the past 100 years, this law has turned into a tool of state secrecy. The evolution of the Espionage Act has done a great deal to shape the freedom of political discussions in modern America. What began as a vague law giving President Woodrow Wilson the power to jail critics and censor the media during World War I has turned into a powerful law regulating political discussions through the monitoring of secrets, rather than speech. Censorship did not end with the end of the war. It evolved. Despite its name, the Espionage Act has always been a broad law."
"Google is trying to save presentation audiences from having to listen to long, rambling questions with a new feature it added to its Slides software on Wednesday. Slides Q&A allows audiences to submit text questions over the internet while listening to a presentation using Google's software. As the speaker talks, she can see the questions and respond to them without waiting for someone to get up to the microphone. The view in Google Slides Q&A allows speakers to see what the people in their audience want to know. In addition to submitting questions, audience members can also vote on the ones they want to see answered."
"Manfred Weber (41) is the newly elected chairman of the European People's Party (EPP), the largest political group in the European Parliament after the 2014 elections. He represents the conservative Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) in Germany. Weber spoke with Dario Sarmadi from EURACTIV Germany. David Cameron wants the UK to leave the EU if Jean-Claude Juncker becomes President of the European Commission. What can you say to the British Prime Minister? The UK belongs in the EU - and is stronger within the community itself."
"When Conservative Party leader William Hague walked through a crowd of devoted supporters at a dinner rally on Tuesday, and the emcee introduced the ""next prime minister of Britain"", even many of his supporters could not stifle an involuntary laugh. The Conservative London newspaper The Times for the first time in its history endorsed the Labour Party, backing Prime Minister Tony Blair for a second term. The country's largest bookmaker, Ladbrokes, had already stopped taking bets on Thursday's election and begun paying out winnings on bets on a Labour victory."
"April 24, 2014, 10:30 am.
A few smart news companies are seeing growth in digital advertising and smart strategy. But most newspaper companies are coming to the conclusion that key metrics are still moving in the wrong direction. Ken Doctor @kdoctor April 24, 2014, 10:30 am.
As we approach the mid-2010s, where do newspapers stand in the battle for America's biggest advertising sector - digital? And how well are all those paywalls working? Two reports have gone public in back-to-back weeks recently, and together they help answer both questions."
"From the M1917 to the M1A2, American tanks have dominated the battlefield. The US Army and Marine Corps are on the cusp of a centennial anniversary - 100 years of tanks in American service. This animated GIF, compiled by the people at partcatalog.com, shows the evolution of the American tank - from the flimsy light tank M1917 to the M1A2 Abrams - and demonstrates how the US transformed from a novice in the world of tanks to a world leader. The M1917 light tank, for example, was simply a copy of the Renault FT-17. Such an approach to copying engineering would be unthinkable now."
"The first of such groups to be named was the Bajrang Dal, whose activist burned alive an Australian missionary Graham Staines along with his two young sons in Orissa in 1999. This heart-wrenching incident is cited as an early example of saffron terror in India. The ugly face of Hindutva terrorism was again in the spotlight after the arrest of three people in Maharashtra for an alleged plot to carry out ""terrorist acts"" in various parts of the state. According to the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), 22 items were seized from the accused's house in Pune."
"Meet ... Ron Brown from AAG Archaeology with the netty door. Below is a photograph of the Westoe Netty. The toilet door, found in a historic building in South Tyneside, now occupies a place of honour in one of the North East's most popular tourist attractions. During a survey of a Regency townhouse on Beach Road in South Shields, staff from North East-based company AAG Archaeology discovered what may be the only netty door to have made it into a museum collection. It was the eagle eye of archaeologist Ron Brown that spotted what is believed to be the best preserved example of a classic North East netty door, protruding from the rubble of a demolished toilet."
"The best part of M. Night Shyamalan's 2017 horror film ""Split"" - and one of the few things he got right - occurred right at the end. A brief, stunning revelation featuring Bruce Willis reprising his role as David Dunn from ""Unbreakable"", created a shared universe that Shyamalan was all too eager to capitalize on. Unfortunately, there's a big difference between tantalizing fans with a momentary cameo, and building a story around it. ""Glass"", the third film in what's become a trilogy, feels like a jumble of underformed ideas, mixed into an uneven brew."

"Sign the RootsAction petition to mayors and police chiefs across the country affirming your support for the right to unlimited peaceful protest. Occupy Wall Street protesters scored a major victory on Friday when Mayor Bloomberg and Brookfield Properties, the owners of New York's Zuccotti Park, backed down from demands that activists temporarily vacate the park for cleaning and subsequently abide by new rules banning sleeping bags, most equipment, and even lying down. Protesters in many other cities have not been so lucky."
"Products of Progressive Networks, RealAudio and RealVideo for streaming, got an impulse for development today, as it became known that Microsoft plans to acquire a minority stake in the company and get a license for its key products, RealAudio and RealVideo 4.0. As part of the agreement, Microsoft will integrate Progressive technologies into Internet Explorer clients and the NetShow streaming server, and the companies will cooperate to ensure compatibility of their server and client products. In turn, Progressive will support Microsoft's Active Streaming Format (ASF) as well as its own file formats, and use Microsoft's DirectShow and DirectDraw APIs, as well as other technologies in future versions of its clients for Windows."
"ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) - Mike Minor was able to finish what he started, something the left-hander couldn't do for the Texas Rangers in his return to the rotation last season. The Angels are 2-14 on the road since September, while going 12-2 at home. ... The Rangers have homered in all 10 home games, their longest season-opening home homer streak in Texas history. ... It was the second shutout of the season for Texas, both at home, after they had only one home shutout all of last season."

By moving protection to the network level, Box products protect all devices on the network, including refrigerators, game consoles, and security cameras."
"Technology company leaders are discussing the impact of automation technologies on their organizations. For many organizations and their employees, technological automation is both an opportunity and a threat. On the one hand, the use of automation, robotic process automation, and other tools creates efficiency by automating manual and repetitive tasks. On the other hand, it has the potential to make jobs redundant. Technology company leaders recently gathered for roundtable discussions in Sydney and Melbourne to discuss the impact of automation technologies on their organizations. One of the key issues raised during the discussion was the challenge of ensuring compliance with policy and governance procedures when replacing human-performed tasks with ""bots"" across the company."
"Baceapp Corporation and LightSpin Technologies Inc. will be moving into Binghamton University's engineering and science building. The two companies plan to create 39 jobs and invest $540,000 over the next five years while being in Binghamton University's tax-free zones, as announced on Monday by Governor Andrew Cuomo's office. Baceapp Corporation and LightSpin Technologies Inc., which will be moving into Binghamton University's engineering and science building, were two of the 17 companies introduced on Monday as new participants in the Start-Up NY program, which offers 10 years of tax freedom in locations near or on college campuses."
"WASHINGTON, March 1 - After a year in which a record number of natural disasters costing over $1 billion were recorded, representatives of leading insurance companies stated today that the costs to taxpayers and businesses due to extreme weather conditions will continue to rise because of climate change. Insurers joined Senators Bernie Sanders (Independent - Vermont) and Sheldon Whitehouse (Democrat - Rhode Island) at a press conference to discuss the growing financial impact of global warming. Both Vermont and Rhode Island were affected by Tropical Storm Irene in August of last year, one of 14 record-breaking natural disasters in the US last year, each causing over $1 billion in damage."
"It was another quarter of rapid growth for the optical equipment manufacturer, but shares fell as investors were uninspired by the revenue forecast. Infinera (NASDAQ:INFN) released its Q1 results on April 27 after the market closed. Although the results slightly exceeded the company's own guidance, traders sold shares throughout Thursday's trading session as the company forecast that growth would slow in the next quarter. By 3:40 p.m., shares had fallen almost 24% from the previous close. Let's take a closer look at the results to see how the company performed in three areas that I think investors should focus on."
"Edgar Wright has never made a bad film, he hasn't even made a film that's just good, and so it's completely logical that up until now in his career, Wright has avoided direct sequels. However, this may change with the film ""Baby Driver"". When ""Shaun of the Dead"" had huge success, instead of using it to create a zombie sequel, Wright, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost made thematically linked trilogy of films - ""The Cornetto Trilogy"" - with also excellent ""Hot Fuzz"" and ""The World's End""."
"The TTP apparently cannot fund its operations due to a lack of money. ISLAMABAD: The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has faced a severe financial crisis since its slain founder Baitullah Mehsud united several disparate groups from all corners of the tribal territory to form the deadliest terrorist network of homegrown militants in 2007. ""The Taliban have seriously depleted their financial resources... they have almost no money left,"" said at least three associates of the group against the backdrop of a surprising lull in their activities - bombings and terrorist attacks across Pakistan and in some parts of Afghanistan - over the past few months."
"In the third quarter of 2018, luxury home prices rose 3.2% from the previous year to reach a median sale price of $1.7 million, according to the latest data from Redfin. Redfin defines luxury homes as those that were sold among the top 5% most expensive in the quarter. According to the company, sales of homes priced at $2 million or more increased for the ninth consecutive time. However, this is the slowest growth rate since the beginning of 2016. Additionally, the number of homes for sale priced at $2 million or more decreased by 6% compared to the previous year."

"The Chief Financial Officers' Council reported last month that the Small Business Administration needs to improve planning for its new database system. The Small Business Administration had planned to introduce the Electronic Loan Processing and Information System (ELIPS), which is used to track government loans for small businesses online last week, but the CFO Council stated that the agency had not shown that the project was a good investment. The Small Business Administration said it did not have time to complete the analysis required by the Clinger-Cohen Act because Congress required the system to be introduced by June 30. The US Army Materiel Command has published guidelines for improving teamwork between agencies and contractors."
"Surinamese intelligence agencies. Photo by Sanoesie101, Wikipedia. Location of Surinam. Source: CIA World Factbook. In 1980, a group of non-commissioned officers (NCOs) overthrew the elected government, despite intense resistance from the poorly armed police, who were only suppressed after the navy bombarded them and forced them to surrender. This led to the establishment of a de facto military dictatorship (although a civilian president formally existed) in the country for the next seven years, led by Sergeant-Major (self-promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel) Dési Delano Bouterse."
"The Lifetime channel has announced that it will show a film about the relationship between Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown. And the network has done everything to invite a veteran actress who starred alongside the singer in the film ""Waiting to Exhale"" to direct the biographical film. Angela Bassett, 55, is set to make her directorial debut in the television film, which will focus on the late pop star who died in 2012. Lifetime has announced that the film will tell the story of Houston and Brown from their first meeting to their tumultuous marriage. It also promises to tell the story of the singer's rise to fame with the song ""I Will Always Love You""."
"For the first time I heard these verses in a small church located in a store in Kiev, Ukraine. I remember it because it was on the same Sunday that the tragic death of Princess Diana was reported. I had recently quit my job on Wall Street and was living in Kiev with my mother after my father had passed away, and I was there because I was having bad luck finding my way forward. I remember the wooden paneling on the walls of the room where I sat in the back, a bit embarrassed by the enthusiasm of my fellow evangelists. But when I heard these verses, my wandering mind returned."
"She grew up in a predominantly white, working-class neighborhood. ""We were the only black people, and I was regularly called racist names,"" she recalls. ""Lying in bed, I prayed and asked to be taught to teach children to be kind to me and others."" ""This led me to having a 'rainbow of friends' - Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Rastafarians, and Christians. I always wanted to connect with the heart and soul of people, regardless of faith or culture."
"Getty Images photographer John Moore will receive the Impact Award from the Lucie Awards program on Sunday at Carnegie Hall in New York. These awards honor outstanding achievements in photography. Moore will join eight other honorees who will be recognized for their work at the awards ceremony. This is not the first award for the photojournalist, who grew up in Irving and graduated from the University of Texas at Austin. He has already received the 2005 Pulitzer Prize for News Photography, two awards from the Foreign Correspondents' Club, and the title of ""Photographer of the Year"" from Pictures of the Year International, as well as other awards."
"Guess what? The NBA is indeed show business. Only super producer David Stern doesn't pull all the strings from behind the scenes (otherwise, the ""New York"" would somehow have won the draft lottery). On the contrary, the league moves like an extremely expensive and uncontrolled Hollywood production - driven by the egos of big players, full of stunning plot twists, prone to endless rewrites. And to think: we haven't even mentioned the ""Los Angeles Lakers"" yet. Unfortunately, the biggest news of the season has nothing to do with basketball."
"Doug Newcomb 2015 Lincoln MKC If you want a stylish, affordable luxury crossover that's an alternative to the usual import suspects, the 2015 Lincoln MKC is a compelling choice. Relatively affordable price. Wide range of driver assist options. Quiet cabin. Outdated infotainment interface. Less lively engine compared to competitors. If you want a stylish, affordable luxury crossover that's an alternative to the usual import suspects, the 2015 Lincoln MKC is a compelling choice. While Ford is setting sales records and making money hand over fist, its luxury Lincoln division is largely lagging behind the competition."
"NASA is going to lower a small robot into a volcano in Hawaii to map its internal data and geographical features such as fissures and volcanic vents. A similar robot is already exploring the volcano. ""We don't know exactly how volcanoes erupt. We have models, but they're all very, very simplified. This project is aimed at making those models more realistic,"" said Carolyn Parcheta, a postdoctoral researcher based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, according to NASA. The NASA-developed robot can climb in the areas inaccessible to humans."
"Hearst Magazines will be busy in 2018, completing its acquisition of Rodale, buying some magazines in the Netherlands and increasing the frequency of two of its latest titles. The Pioneer Woman Magazine, a joint venture with blogger and Food Network star Ree Drummond, published two fully sold-out issues in 2017 and will double its frequency to four issues in 2018, as Hearst Magazines president David Carey told employees in his year-end letter. It's a good turn for Airbnb, which tried to launch its own magazine called Pineapple in 2014, but it only lasted one issue."

A Dundee nursery has been unable to increase its intake of children. Dundee inventor John Cruickshank has died at the age of 84. It all started as an act of defiance that quickly spread around the world.

"The daughter of the editor of a Kannada tabloid, arrested for allegedly hiring a hitman to kill a fellow journalist, today claimed that her father was ""not guilty"" and would ""safely"" come out of the case. Ravi Belagere, who publishes the Hi Bangalore tabloid, was arrested yesterday from his home for allegedly hiring a ""supari"" killer from Vijayapura in northern Karnataka to kill Sunil Heggaravalli. ""No one has filed a complaint with the police in this case based on a complaint filed by someone. This is a case registered by the police on their own based on the statement of Shailesh (the hitman)""."
"Manatees are large, grey, aquatic mammals. They have thick bodies - I think 'full figures' is how clothing companies try to convince manatees to buy larger jeans - that taper to a flat, paddle-like tail. Adult manatees typically reach lengths of about 3 metres and weigh between 360 and 540 kilograms. Manatees are one of God's ugliest oceanic creations, and there are a lot of weird sea creatures. These are facts - well, the observation about ugliness is an opinion, but it's obvious enough to be considered a fact - that I learned from the Save the Manatee Club website."

"A French woman who received the world's first partial face transplant showed off her new features to the public on Monday, speaking in a raspy voice, saying she now looks ""like everyone else"" and hopes to return to a normal life. Isabelle Dinoire's speech was difficult to understand, but she explained how she was disfigured by a dog bite last year, and she thanked the donor's family, who gave her new lips, chin, and nose. A thin, circular scar was still visible where the facial tissue had been grafted on during the 15-hour operation in Amiens on November 27."
"Did Donald Trump release Donald Trump's tax return? For a moment, it seemed like Rachel Maddow had gotten a huge scoop. And then, suddenly, everything changed…. Thanks to MSNBC, the assumption that Trump ""hadn't paid taxes in 18 years"" was now proven false. Moreover, Trump apparently paid a higher tax rate in 2005 than most politicians, and, furthermore, had a fairly large income. It is unknown whether the reporting was selectively edited."
"MOUNT PLEASANT, Sanpete County - Education officials are asking students without current vaccinations to stay home for several weeks as Sanpete County deals with a mumps outbreak. According to a statement from North Sanpete School District Superintendent Dr. Sam Ray, there have been two confirmed cases of mumps in Sanpete County. One of them is a school district student, he said. Another potential case of mumps is currently under investigation, and health officials are awaiting test results, Ray said. Ray did not say which school the student with mumps attends, but said North Sanpete Middle School is the ""epicenter"" of the outbreak."
"In hard times, creative bakers turned to desperation pies: salt and vinegar pie and green tomato pie are not typically on America's list of favorite sweets. But in Depression-era America, these and other desperation pies that have survived to the present day demonstrated the resourcefulness of home cooks. Some desperation pies, such as green tomato pie, still enjoy niche success today. Imagine yourself as a resourceful farmer during the Great Depression. You want to make a dessert for your family, but traditional pie ingredients like cherries or pecans are too expensive or unavailable."
"There is a Speed Graphic camera, once standard equipment in newsrooms across the country. You may have seen them in movies from the 1930s and 40s, where groups of photographers wore ""Press"" badges in the bands of their fedoras. Heavy, cumbersome, and requiring flashbulbs the size of light bulbs to shoot at night, the Speed Graphic was the first camera I used professionally, for my high school yearbook and the newspaper I worked on part-time while in high school and college. The one that sits in my office used sheet film - you took a shot, pulled out the film holder, and inserted another."
"Anyone who has ever been frustrated with the task of shooting video in low light should be prepared for excitement over Canon's strange and wonderful new camera. It's a video camera that shoots full HD video in almost complete darkness. The ""multipurpose"" camera, dubbed the MH20F-SH, features a full!-frame sensor with 2.26 megapixels. The reason for the modest resolution is that each pixel is very large — a whopping 19 microns. That's 7.5 times larger than, say, the pixels found on a top!-of!-the!-line DSLR like the Canon 1Dx."
"Is our efficient tax office killing this country? I have never seen a story where the Reserve Bank has called on the government to provide tax breaks, but that's exactly what's happening now, which partly explains why our economy is going backwards. In fact, the result of this historically unusual story is that the tax commissioner, Chris Jordan, and his team are doing a great job in uncovering excessive claims for deductions, particularly by businesses. With productivity gains through computer technology, the state's tax revenues are increasing."
"A facility manager wears many hats. It's not uncommon for a facility manager to run a meeting, give plumbing advice, present a renovation project, and ensure proper floor cleaning - all in one day. Facility managers consider the safety and health of all building users as they figure out how the facility operates. To be a successful facility manager, a strong foundation in management, technical skills, construction fundamentals, and technologies is necessary. The facility manager provides oversight of the building's physical infrastructure or structural campus."
"A communications professor at Texas A&M University wanted to learn about the effects of changes in the newspaper industry on our national politics, so she conducted some research that was published in the Journal of Communication. If you've noticed that there seems to have been a sharp rise in political polarization over the past few years, you're not imagining it. And, as Johanna Dunaway and some colleagues at the Universities of Colorado and Louisiana found, this polarization occurred during a period of steady decline in the number of local newspapers and journalists across the country."
"WASHINGTON -- An Iowa egg producer at the center of a national salmonella outbreak apologized to the congressional committee on Wednesday and acknowledged that his family business ""grew too big too fast."" ""What I mean by that is we grew too big too fast before we started putting in place the sophisticated procedures to make sure we were meeting all of the government requirements,"" egg producer Austin J. DeCoster testified before the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee. He is the founder of an egg empire that over three decades has been linked to several deadly salmonella outbreaks in multiple states."
"A Conservative candidate who stood in local elections was barred from standing by his party after failing to declare his unresolved drink-driving case, for which he was later convicted. Ben Wong, 48, of the South Dragon House restaurant on Silver Street, had put himself forward to stand in the Victoria ward election on May 2 under the Conservative banner, but was ditched after his conviction. The deadline for nominations was April 3, but he appeared before Taunton magistrates on March 21 - which was unknown to Somerset Conservatives."
"Batfleck is officially no longer a thing. Ben Affleck has officially stepped down from his role as Bruce Wayne in the Batman film. And he's passing the torch to a new actor, who has yet to be confirmed. Warner Bros. announced the official release date for The Batman earlier today, with the DC adventure set to hit theaters on June 25, 2021. Shortly after the news broke, Ben Affleck took to social media to wish director Matt Reeves good luck in taking the caped crusader into the future. The tweet was later confirmed as Ben Affleck's goodbye to the character."
"When people dine at a restaurant, it's customary to leave a tip, but one particular charge for ordering a milkshake and fries at a New Jersey diner has outraged parents. ""My daughter would come home and tell me that every time she and her friends went to the diner, they were being charged a tip,"" said Melissa Desh. ""And when I asked her why, she said: 'Because they're kids'."" Desh said her daughter, Isabella, and other Schuyler-Colfax Middle School students frequently go to the Wayne Hills Diner, located just across the Hamburg Turnpike from the school."
"DALLAS - Like many Americans, Martin Jacobson was thrilled that U.S. Navy SEALs had captured and killed Osama bin Laden. But the Dallas resident felt a deeper connection to the people who tracked down the mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. A few decades ago, he was one of them. During World War II, Jacobson was part of an elite group that was the precursor to the Navy SEALs. The secretive special forces are accustomed to being out of the spotlight, but they're back in the glare after the bin Laden killing. ""I'm just proud of the SEALs,"" said Jacobson, 89."
"Northern Ireland was today named the race hate capital of Europe in a report on racist violence in the province. Doreen Lawrence, a human rights activist and the mother of murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence, arrived in Belfast for the launch of the Northern Ireland Council for Ethnic Minorities (NICEM) report. The report identified institutional racism in the justice system and questioned how to reduce it. Racist violence has been increasing in Northern Ireland in recent years, and not just against black and Asian people, but almost against anyone who is perceived as different."
"About 300 residents of Kandal province, involved in land disputes with private companies, delivered petitions to embassies in Phnom Penh yesterday and then held a protest in front of the provincial council building, calling on Prime Minister Hun Sen to help them. Village residents told the newspaper that they want to put an end to the land disputes caused by companies that ""took their land"", adding that they are ""willing to die"" rather than go home without a result. They stated that the authorities are ignoring their requests for help, while the companies are using the judicial system to arrest village residents who complain about the seizures."
"The incline press is a strength training exercise that targets the chest and the front deltoids. The exercise is performed by lying on an incline bench, then grasping dumbbells or a barbell above, and extending and flexing the elbows to lift the weight above the chest. Incline chest press machines, which mimic the movement in a fixed plane, are another way to perform the exercise. The incline press is one of several exercises that help create symmetry and strength in the muscles of the upper body."
"JURGEN KLOPP revealed his delight at ending PEP GUARDIOLA'S 22-match unbeaten run without a loss with Manchester City, exclaiming live: ""What was that?!"" And the Liverpool manager also hit back at critics targeting his vulnerable defence, adding: ""Blow my boots!"" Klopp was thrilled after masterminding a thrilling 4-3 win over the league leaders at Anfield this morning. The second half was a real onslaught, with Liverpool quickly going 4-1 up before City scored two late goals to create a nervy finish."
"No one asked me, but... if you pay dues to a neo-Nazi organization, subscribe to racist publications, buy tickets to a Holocaust denial conference, and have Holocaust denial DVDs in your video collection, you're probably a neo-Nazi. That doesn't mean you'll be a neo-Nazi forever. You can change your mind and your thoughts, and reform. If you want people to believe you're no longer a neo-Nazi, you've got a lot to prove. Shedding the brown shirt takes a lot of work."
"The first sign of redemption for Brent Moloney after his post-match drinking session came mid-season when he was quietly reinstated to the club's leadership group. The second, far more public and significant than the first, came last night when he won Melbourne's best and fairest award. Moloney, 27, took out the Keith 'Bluey' Truscott Trophy, edging out key defenders Jared Rivers and James Frawley at the Crown Palladium ceremony. Two of Moloney's midfield partners, Nathan Jones and Jack Trengove, finished fourth and fifth respectively."
"The Weeknd will team up with Daft Punk for a performance at the Grammy Awards. LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Weeknd will team up with Daft Punk for a performance at the Grammy Awards. The collaboration between the singer and the electronic music duo is one of several announced on Tuesday. Anderson .Paak will take the stage with A Tribe Called Quest and Dave Grohl. Maren Morris is set to perform with Alicia Keys. The Grammys had previously announced that Adele, John Legend, Bruno Mars, Metallica, Carrie Underwood, and Keith Urban will also perform."
"DARTMOUTH - On June 14, Flag Day, students at the James M. Quinn Elementary School in Dartmouth gathered outside to celebrate Flag Day. In itself, this is not unusual, but this year it took on a more personal meaning. The reason for this is that the cousin of Dr. Carol Karadotis, Ted Cote of New Bedford, is serving in Iraq. Earlier this year, around Veterans Day, Dr. Karadotis had asked her students to send cards to Sergeant Cote to boost his morale. The students responded and made cards, which were then sent to Iraq."
"Will UBS Wealth Management be led by Bob McCann or Sallie Krawcheck? Former head of Merrill Lynch's brokerage unit Bob McCann and former head of Citigroup's wealth management Sallie Krawcheck are both being considered as possible leaders of UBS Wealth Management. Investment News reported that two industry recruiters said both names ""are already being discussed"". Earlier, the Financial Times reported that UBS's new CEO, Oswald Grubel, had decided not to sell the company's US wealth management business, despite speculation in recent months that he might sell the business following tax evasion charges and the subsequent scandal."
"If the US presidential election were to be decided through social media, Barack Obama would clearly win this year against Republican candidate Mitt Romney. Obama's campaign is actively using social media, and the president has a huge advantage in the number of followers on Facebook and Twitter, and one of the divisions of the Democratic National Committee is using private social media tools to communicate with some campaign staff. There is also evidence that the Obama team is using social media analytics to gauge voter sentiment and track the popularity of campaign messages. None of the campaigns contacted to discuss their social media strategies responded to messages."
"Let's take a moment to define what impact investing is. Great! Now that they're gone, we can get down to business. For over four years, I've covered impact investing as a regular Forbes contributor and written hundreds of articles on the topic. Here's the thing: most impact investments are only open to high net worth individuals. This impact investing guide is for everyone else, the 98% of the population who don't meet the criteria to invest alongside the wealthy."
"Health authorities have issued another measles warning after a person who was on public transport visited two universities and a food store while infectious. The warning is the fourth in recent weeks. The latest person to be infected visited several public places between Sunday, January 7, and Wednesday, January 30.

"Sunny weather is expected today as high pressure sets in over the weekend. After a chilly start, temperatures will rise into the upper 40s and lower 50s. A cool evening is expected under mostly clear skies. Lows will be in the upper 20s and lower 30s. The wind will be blowing from the south tomorrow, which means we'll see milder temperatures. Expect highs in the upper 50s. Some communities may reach 60. However, thicker clouds develop as the day progresses. It appears the clouds will clear out at night with lows in the upper 30s and lower 40s."
"It looked like a scene after an earthquake. A sea of orange boxes was scattered all over the floor, shoes were jammed into every nook, and stunned people stood in shock. But it wasn't a disaster. It was Black Friday at the Nike store in Seattle. Horrified shoppers at the Seattle Premium Outlets in Tulalip, Washington, posted photos and videos of the appalling state of the store after the holiday weekend. They show people carelessly stepping on boxes protecting Nike shoes as they make their way through the store, mindlessly grabbing and tossing sneakers along the way."
"The 27th annual Franti Southwest Iowa Balloon Days is taking place this week in Creston. Balloon Committee Representative Bill Fastenow says the wind is the determining factor on whether the balloons will fly and, of course, their destination. Fastenow says there will be a pilots' meeting today (Saturday) at 4:30 PM, followed by a ""night glow"" at the Creston airport south of town, which he says is quite a sight. Creston Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Ellen Gerhart says at least 57 aeronauts have signed up to participate in this week's events."

"The unemployment rate in Stark County dropped to 6.8 percent in August, the lowest since September 2008. For the first time since 2008, the unemployment rate in Stark County has dipped below 7 percent, and it's likely that multiple factors contributed to the decline. The main suspect is the influx of businesses to the area due to the Utica Shale oil and natural gas drilling. Oil exploration companies moved into the area, followed by engineering and construction firms providing various services. Manufacturing has also experienced a boost due to increased local and national demand for steel and drilling equipment."
"A horror movie star will visit one of the scariest places in Gaston County on Wednesday and Thursday. Actor Derek Mears, who has appeared in the films ""Friday the 13th"" (2009), ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"", ""Predators"", and ""Men in Black II"", will meet horror fans at a place called the ""Abandoned Mill"" in Belmont. Kevin Blanchfield, the owner of the mill, said that he tries to offer something new and interesting every year at the location. He expects the appearance of ""Friday the 13th"" character Jason Voorhees to boost weekday attendance. The mill usually draws around 200-300 people on weekday evenings before Halloween."
"WASHINGTON (Alliance News) - Gold prices remained stable on Thursday after the Federal Reserve's latest report on the state of the economy showed that businesses across the US had become less optimistic in recent months. Spot gold rose 0.2% to $1,294.11 an ounce, while US gold futures were virtually unchanged at $1,293.75 an ounce. As economic concerns intensify, the Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates at current levels at least until June. The dollar paused today after recent gains, and the pound stabilized after UK Prime Minister Theresa May won a vote of confidence in parliament and urged lawmakers to break the deadlock in the Brexit agreement."
"President Jacob Zuma believes that the Public Protector's state capture report was a political tool designed to be used against certain individuals. In an exclusive interview with ANN7 on Monday evening, Zuma spoke out about the state capture report compiled by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela, in which she recommended that Zuma appoint a commission of inquiry into state capture and that Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng choose the judge to preside over it. The report investigated whether Zuma's friends - the scandalous Gupta family - had undue influence over the executive."
"Why we love it: Few things are as stylish as a good night's sleep. After all, a well-rested night can leave you feeling fresh - and refreshed - in the morning. Perhaps one of the key factors contributing to quality sleep is a good mattress. The new mattress, available in sizes from twin to California king, consists of five layers of ""premium"" foam, including a one-inch ""flo"" foam, 1.5-inch latex foam, 1.5-inch viscoelastic memory foam, 1.5-inch high-resilience foam and supportive gel pillows, and more."
"Jenna Barker of Seton Catholic set a sectional record by winning the 1600 meters in 5 minutes 13.04 seconds, and also won the 800 meters, as several local athletes qualified for regional during the IHSAA girls track sectional championship on Tuesday at Connersville High School. Other individual sectional champions were Riley Austin of Richmond in the 200 meters and long jump, Nakala Bennett of Richmond in the 100 meters, Hannah Stamm of Seton Catholic in the 3200 meters, and Austin, Lindsay Griffin, Peyton Vanniddlesworth, and Riley Wetzel of Richmond in the 4x400 relay."
"When the theme of the convention seemed to be ""Drill, baby, drill"", which is an energy policy in exactly the same way that ""Tax, baby, tax"" is a fiscal policy (i.e. it doesn't exist), the slogans appear to be all that's left of the party. Even if you think that increasing oil exploration and drilling by drilling offshore makes sense, you can't take these people seriously. Unfortunately, you can. This moment, by the way, was the moment when I became completely disillusioned with the convention."
"The new chair of the National Children's Hospital board has stated that it would be a ""bad thing"" if the State were to allow the hospital's main contractor to withdraw from its role. Board chair Fred Barry, who is currently appearing before the Oireachtas health committee, also said that from a very early stage in the project there had been an ""underestimation"" of its cost, which led to cost overruns to €1.73 billion compared to the initial estimate of €800 million in 2014."
"Bob Cannard turns over compost that was originally made from San Francisco's food waste at Green String Farms near Petaluma, California, on Friday, March 6, 2009. As a parent and someone who has worked with parents for many years, I was struck by the front-page article about the heart-wrenching case of an infant's death in El Cerrito (""Toddler's death in car a tragic lesson for all parents,"" June 10). The assumption that parents can ""easily forget that their children are in the back seat"" is, unfortunately, all too true."
"Summary: Southeast Toyota Distributors (SET) is recalling certain model year 2016 Toyota Yaris, Rav4, Land Cruiser, and 4Runner, as well as Scion FR-S, iM, and TC vehicles manufactured from January 28, 2016, to March 14, 2016. The affected vehicles may have a label that does not reflect the correct added weight of the installed accessories. As a result, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard number 110, ""Tire Selection and Rims for Motor Vehicles"". Consequence: The incorrect label may lead to vehicle overload, increasing the risk of a crash."
"An American Civil Liberties Union attorney asked a federal appeals court in San Francisco to block a California law that requires police to collect a DNA sample from anyone arrested on suspicion of a serious crime. The law is part of a 2004 voter initiative that gradually expanded the categories of people in the criminal justice system from whom DNA is collected through a cheek swab. Four plaintiffs are challenging the provision, which took effect in 2009 and requires DNA collection from everyone arrested on suspicion of a serious crime, regardless of whether they are charged or convicted of a crime."
"Really? Was it that complicated? The Green Bay Press-Gazette reports that authorities claim they are two to three weeks away from completing their investigation into the alleged sexual assault involving Packers cornerback Brandon Underwood. Underwood is accused by two Milwaukee women of attacking them in the Lake Delton area of Wisconsin, a resort zone, after a charity event. The alleged incident occurred on June 5, and within days of the incident, police officials stated that they doubted any charges would come from the incident. One of the main issues was that the women's stories allegedly changed: initially they accused several Packers players, then only Underwood."
"A new logo to help define how the community perceives Seminole County's school system is soon to be developed, using at least one of the four top designs that won in the county's logo contest. School board members have stated that they want a new logo because the system's current logo - a school stop sign - does not reflect the county's academic achievements. The contest was divided into four age groups: 10 years old and under as the elementary group, 11-14 years old in the junior group, 15-18 years old in the senior group, and 19 years old and over in the adult group."
"LOS ANGELES (AP) - Kings forward Anze Kopitar will undergo surgery on Wednesday to repair a torn ligament in his severely sprained right ankle. An MRI exam on Monday confirmed that the Kings' top scorer will require corrective surgery that will keep him out of the lineup for an undetermined period. Kopitar injured the ankle when he fell awkwardly during the Kings' win over Colorado on Saturday. Coach Terry Murray initially said the Slovenian all-star had broken his ankle and would be out at least six weeks, but the Kings ultimately determined the injury was a severe ankle sprain. Kopitar leads the Kings with 25 goals and 43 assists."
"Two people were injured in a crash on State Highway 2 near Waikaramarama. What was initially reported as a three-car collision yesterday, police now believe was two separate crashes that occurred in almost the same spot near Apatu Station Road. A St John Ambulance spokeswoman said two people were taken from the scene to Tauranga Hospital, one in a serious condition and one in a moderate condition. Police were first called to the area at about 1:10pm. ""Two crashes occurred in a short space of time in the same area. It appears an SUV has left the road and then there was a collision between a car and a truck."
"Richard Randolph Lamb, a resident of Dunsmuir, passed away on September 17, 2009, at Mercy Medical Center in Mount Shasta. Richard was born in Fairview, Montana. He moved to Siskiyou County from Oregon in 1919. Richard was a U.S. Navy veteran, serving in the Pacific Fleet during World War II. He worked as a locomotive engineer for the Southern Pacific Railroad for 34 years. Richard was a member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Dunsmuir. His hobbies included bowling, cars, music, traveling, and a love for his family."
"The Korean Shipbuilders' Association and the Shipyard Association released figures that confirm the expectations of many analysts: the number of active shipyards worldwide has decreased by more than 40 percent compared to what it was seven years ago. In the study, an active shipyard was understood to be a facility that had at least one ship in its order book. The number of active shipyards in China decreased from 380 to 140, and in Japan from 70 to 60 during the same period, the association reported. Additionally, the world's largest shipyards - DSME, Hyundai Heavy, and Samsung Heavy - may face empty yards and unused capacity as early as next year."
"""Interaction of Color"", a 1963 book by Josef Albers, a German artist and educator who taught at the Bauhaus, Black Mountain College, and Yale University throughout his legendary career, is not intended solely for beginning artists. Its fascinating illustrations are a revelation for anyone interested in color theory and human perception. On Thursday, in honor of the book's 50th anniversary, Yale University Press, the publisher of the original edition, will offer a new way to engage with Albers' lessons, releasing an ""Interaction of Color"" app for the iPad."
"MELBOURNE, Australia - Defending champion Victoria Azarenka struggled to fend off a wounded American Jamie Hampton 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 on Saturday, advancing to the fourth round of the Australian Open. Hampton, who required a medical timeout due to a lower back issue before winning the second set, and often grimaced in pain, was on the verge of tears throughout the third set, yet still managed to make 41 winners to keep the world's top-ranked player Azarenka under pressure. Azarenka occasionally appeared frustrated, but overcame an early break and fended off three break points in the seventh game of the deciding set, before winning the match in 2 hours and 9 minutes."
"Suzuki revealed information about improper testing on 6,401 units out of 12,819 since 2012. Dealing a significant blow to the Japanese automaker, Suzuki Motor company announced that it used improper testing for fuel efficiency and emissions on its vehicles in Japan. According to Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport, Suzuki, along with Mazda and Toyota, admitted to cheating on emissions tests and submitted reports on sample vehicles that were selected in the quality assurance process. Additionally, the samples underwent testing under improper driving conditions. However, the company is not currently considering a product recall."
"Brands should resist the temptation to take on a hot topic in the Super Bowl as a way to stand out, said Aimee Drolet, a professor of marketing and behavioral decisions at the University of California, Los Angeles's Anderson School of Management. ""It's usually not the best platform for it, because the audience is so broad, so you're inevitably going to alienate half the people,"" she said. In other news, University of California officials announced that the 10-campus system set a new fundraising record in 2017-18, bringing in more than $2.7 billion."
"Margaret O'Brien, 69, moved from Canada to Wolverhampton in 1971, got married, had three children and spent more than 25 years working for the local council as a dinner lady, a meals on wheels driver, a lollipop lady and a cleaner. A back injury forced her to quit her job a few years ago, resulting in her claiming benefits for the first time. In 2015, she was told her disability payments were being suspended because she was an illegal immigrant. A letter informed her ""of our intention to remove you from the UK to your country of nationality, if you do not depart voluntarily""."
"Let's just stop trying to classify them and just be happy, okay? I'll just tell everyone who's interested if Taylor Swift and Calvin Harris are dating: they're just dating. You've probably heard Taylor's song from the 1989 album ""I Know Places"". It's a song about developing a relationship while the paparazzi are chasing them. ""Something's gonna happen when everybody finds out / See the vultures circling, dark clouds / Love's a fragile little thing, it could slip away"", she sings. Just hold on, Haylor."
"PARIS (Reuters) - Longchamp, one of France's leading handbag makers, plans to increase its presence in China, its chief executive said, in stark contrast to competitors which are scaling back operations, despite an economic slowdown and shift in consumer culture in the country. Many top luxury brands, such as Kering's Gucci (PRTP.PA) and LVMH's Louis Vuitton (LVMH.PA), are slowing store openings in China as part of campaigns to preserve their exclusive image. ""We are still far from being fully developed in China,"" said Jean Cassegrain, chief executive of the private group, in an interview with Reuters."
"The Kelly clan's annual gathering is usually a festive affair. Organized by New York Post media columnist Keith J. Kelly, the meeting has been held on St. Patrick's Day for the past three years at Langan's pub on 47th Street. Guests - journalists and others - celebrate their shared Kelly surname and innate Irishness over a plate of corned beef and cabbage and one or two pints of Guinness. But the mood shifted when Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly appeared. Wearing a green tie, he tried to keep things light: ""The Kellys are fun people,"" he declared."
"NEW YORK — Just minutes before noon on Wednesday, Australian Ambassador and President of the United Nations Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty Peter Woolcott presented his final version of a global arms control agreement. After the release of the document, Woolcott notified delegates that they have 24 hours to consult with their respective governments, and then come back tomorrow for a final vote. For many reasons, the US delegation should choose the latter option. Below are several sections of the proposed agreement, each of which would require the federal government to unconstitutionally infringe on the right of Americans to keep and bear arms, protected by the Second Amendment."
"The sixth stage of the Charlevoix Yacht Club summer series took place on August 8 in conditions of light and variable wind. The race was completed by 22 boats, it consisted of a shortened distance of six windward-leeward stages. Affinity became the fastest boat in the overall standings, and only 26 seconds of corrected time separated the first three boats of the Spinnaker A fleet this week. Two more races and one additional stage will determine the overall result of the summer series. The race results were provided by Mike Miller and Keith Attee, committee chairmen. Jib and Main fleet: 1 - Sonnett (Lehman); 2 - Exitus (Pung)."
"A search for the phrase ""toxic mold"" yields hundreds of frightening warnings and ""studies"", but few of them are based on science, and many are motivated by profit. Recently, one of my patients was hospitalized with liver failure due to alcohol. His history of liver disease was well-documented, but he vehemently denied that anyone had ever warned him about the dangers of alcohol. The initial admission of ""a few drinks"" turned into much more with some prodding from various medical workers. Despite his liver being in a state of significant shock, he was stable and lucky enough to retain most of his liver function."
"It's easy to lose democratic mechanisms, but hard to get them back, says the future General Secretary of the Lutheran World. Speaking at St Paul's Cathedral in London, Bishop Catherine Jefferts Schori urged Christians to take action against the world's injustices. The Catholic Church in Scotland has faced questions over plans to charge worshippers to see the Pope during his visit to Glasgow. ""Eleanor's pumpkin has grown so much this week, and she checks on it all the time."""
"(Newser) – After a car fatally struck a 70-year-old pedestrian, the driver's insurance company demanded payment for vehicle repairs – from the deceased woman's daughter. Anna Sedeno, who had recently recovered from cancer, was walking to a bus stop when she was struck by a passing BMW, the New York Post reports. She died two hours later. Police did not issue the driver a ticket, noting that Sedeno was not crossing at a designated crosswalk or intersection. This contradicts their stance only because they were subjected to criticism. Well, you know... corporations are people, my friend."
"The Parliament of Malawi has begun gathering opinions on a bill to limit interest rates, which an opposition member of parliament introduced in the 193-seat parliament to ban commercial banks from charging high interest rates. Alekeni Menyani, the chairperson of the joint committee on public appointments, women's caucus, and committee on statutory corporations, said that there is indeed a need for a law to regulate bank interest rates.

"Without much fanfare, but fortunately with a large number of shoppers, Salisbury quietly opened its central trading area on Saturday, almost three months after it became the site of an international incident. Maltings, which connects the bus park to the city center, has been closed to the public and protected by security measures and tents since former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious on one of its benches after being poisoned. Market traders were relocated outside the trading area by Wiltshire County Council during the decontamination operation."
"It may not be a name that's as frequently uttered as Roku devices, Chromecast, or Fire TV, but the Nvidia Shield TV is quite capable as a media player, enough so that it even made it onto our list of the best players you can buy. Nevertheless, if you have one, you may start to feel a little envious when you see Amazon Alexa voice assistant support popping up on other devices left and right. Don't worry, though, as Nvidia has announced that its Android-based player will be getting Alexa control support."
"Dundee United intend to enter negotiations within the next few days in an attempt to prevent Scotland striker Steven Thompson leaving the club for nothing in the summer. Tannadice's new owner Eddie Thompson is disappointed that recently departed manager Alex Smith and the previous regime did not take steps to tie the 23-year-old player to a new contract. Thompson's contract is due to expire in the summer of next year, by which time he will be 24 and able to leave the club without United receiving any compensation. He will be able to start negotiating with potential new clubs as early as January."
"Real estate search says nothing about community competence or exceptional service. Mobile devices are now the preferred method of interacting with the online world, regardless of purpose or content. Video is no longer an option, use it for authentic representation or risk being forgotten. I have a confession: I don't attend Inman Connect to network. At least, not in the way most people understand it. As a marketing director for an industry service provider, my day job is educating real estate agents. However, when I come to Inman Connect, I get to learn from the agents."

"By detaining Haniyeh, Israel sent a signal that the smuggling of Palestinian money is coming to an end. It is an open secret that Hamas has been smuggling millions of dollars into Gaza through the Rafah crossing since the international community cut financial aid to the Palestinian Authority after Hamas came to power earlier this year. However, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's decision on Thursday to close the Rafah crossing to prevent PA Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh from bringing $35 million into Gaza was the first instance in which Israel actively intervened to stop the flow of money."
"TORONTO — Business owners are demanding significant changes to the King Street pilot project, or they will consider other options, including taking the city to court, says the head of the Ontario Restaurant and Hotel Association. ORHMA president and CEO Tony Elenis said his group has a meeting with Mayor John Tory this Friday, where they hope to hear that the city will lift restrictions on private vehicle traffic after 7 p.m. and on weekends. Measures taken by the city to lure customers back to King Street — including a $5 parking discount — have fallen flat, he said."
"""Fox & Friends"" gathered an all-male panel to weigh in on whether women are hiding ""their lady parts"" 

On Tuesday's Fox & Friends morning show, a panel of men was assembled to determine the ""proper etiquette for wearing leggings"", and they did so in the most refined way possible - by showing young women in leggings in front of them so they could comment on their appearance. The panel was reacting to a video that went viral yesterday, in which a woman, as Steve Doocy repeatedly emphasized, claimed that leggings ""are not pants""."
"It wasn't just that former BP CEO Tony Hayward went sailing on his yacht in the midst of the oil spill crisis, but he also doesn't apologize for it. In his first interview since stepping down as BP CEO, Tony Hayward told the BBC that meeting his son for the first time in three months was just as important. ""I have to say that at the time I was pretty angry,"" he said about the fierce reaction from the White House and people in the Gulf of Mexico. ""I hadn't seen my son for three months."""
"It can be said with confidence that the Cleveland Browns' defender and Arizona State University graduate, Damarious Randall, did not expect this kind of reaction. After the Warriors made it to the NBA finals on Monday evening and secured a rematch with the Cleveland Cavaliers, Randall gave a guarantee on Twitter: ""If the Cleveland Cavaliers win the 2018 NBA finals, I'll buy everyone who retweets this a jersey..."" 
Well, by Wednesday afternoon, Randall's tweet had been retweeted over 800,000 times. That's a lot of jerseys - more than Randall could probably afford to give away."
"Elvira Alonso considers waste recycling a crucial factor for the future. The director of McAllen's Public Works department oversees the city's recycling program and ensures its smooth operation. Plastics, cardboard, glass, and other common materials are transported, shredded, or relocated for reuse at the facility on North Bentsen Road. This operation is a profitable and relieving service for the public good. Clean streets, quality drainage systems, and maintaining the ""Keep McAllen Beautiful"" mission are among the services performed in this sector, said Alonso. Bad products harm the community, and her work turns the negative into positive."
"LONDON -- An IT worker threw away a computer hard drive, unaware it contained the digital currency Bitcoin worth $7.5 million. The device is now buried somewhere in the massive landfill near the home of its owner, James Howells, who realized his mistake only when it was too late.

"The lead seal is the first one found to depict Saint Sabas, an influential figure of local importance 1500 years ago. A rare Crusader-era seal was found in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Kiryat Yovel. The lead seal, dated to around 800 years ago, bears the image of Saint Sabas, one of the most important figures active in Jerusalem during the Byzantine period, about 1500 years ago. Despite the importance of Saint Sabas - whose Syro-Armenian name is Mar Saba - to Christian history in Israel, no seals bearing his image had been found before."
"When I arrived to meet Bono at the bar in his hotel, I noticed Richard Gere sitting at a table with a lovely woman in a tiny fur coat and a leather hat. Bono, on the other hand, had retreated to a quiet back room, where he was chatting with a portly middle-aged white man in a suit and tie. (Bono was dressed in a t-shirt and a fuzzy sweater that needed its sleeve mended.) This was Randall Tobias, the head of the Bush administration's AIDS program. The administration had just announced that the program was providing antiretroviral drugs to 155,000 Africans with AIDS."
"NFL player Keenan Allen spoke out about Bell's song. According to TMZ, in mid-March, Le'Veon Bell, the star running back of the New York Jets, signed a $52.2 million contract with his team.

"Dundee has long been a city of rich character, great wealth and extreme poverty. If the new V&A can give it a transformational boost, it will be worth every penny. I declare an interest. I was at the fledgling University of Dundee in its final year as St Andrews College, and, like many whose lives have been tied to the city, I have retained a strong affection for the place and its people. Not everyone loved it. In those days ""cleansing"" dispatched hordes of the last applicants to what they fondly anticipated as the secluded life of St Andrews Royal College."
"The Mashiach (also known as the Messiah) is the long-awaited Jewish leader who will bring an era of peace and divine consciousness.

"After the Chiefs' season ended in the AFC Championship game, Dee Ford said he had no issue with the team using the franchise tag to keep him in 2019. The Chiefs have made no announcements about their plans, but it appears there are no plans to let Ford go this offseason. Defensive schemes are likely to change with the arrival of Steve Spagnuolo as defensive coordinator instead of Bob Sutton, but pass-rushers are always valued, and general manager Brett Veach didn't seem ready to part with Ford."
"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is investigating a cyberattack on its diplomatic communications, allegedly carried out by Chinese hackers, which exposed the EU's concerns about Donald Trump, Russia, and Iran, the bloc said on Wednesday.

"2 people blamed the murdered woman for their problems, recording showed confession: Crime: The confession came to light during the trial of a man accused of murdering a public figure of the Estonian community. An Estonian refugee and his alleged accomplice had planned to kill themselves because they were hungry and destitute after being abandoned by the Estonian community, but they decided to kill a woman from North Hollywood first, whom they blamed for their problems, so she wouldn't be able to mock their death. The confession was heard in a recorded confession that was played back on Tuesday for the jury of the San Fernando Supreme Court at the trial of Peeter Sakarias, 24."

"Is there such a thing as the perfect bourbon? In fact, for about 20 years now, the distillery has been working on the Holy Grail project: a systematic, clinical pursuit of the ""perfect"" whiskey. By their own accounts, they are close to achieving their goal. Could it happen by the end of April? We can't know for sure, as everything is very secretive.

"A new poll shows that more Americans would choose the Internet as their sole news source than television, radio, and newspapers combined, and Internet reports are considered far more reliable than other media. It also reveals that only 1 in 200 people surveyed thinks that newspapers will be the dominant source of information in 2014.

"Washington (CN) – Republicans laughed at Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood during a hearing on Wednesday after LaHood suggested that biking and walking are just as good modes of transportation as cars.

He claimed that sustainability projects had ""stolen"" $300 million from other programs and personally attacked LaHood for his advocacy of cycling."
"How the internet caught up with the world. The early web: the UNIX team was great, if you knew what you were doing. This month the World Wide Web celebrated its 20th anniversary, and its birthday was marked around the world. It was a pleasant change, as a medium that was once hailed as a new frontier of hope, after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, was viewed with suspicion. We had spent years being outraged by the possibility that our choice of washing machines and underwear was being influenced by sneaky internet advertising, and in 2018 we learned that even voters' choices were open to manipulation."
"The crowd's reaction to the bombs at the finish line, in my opinion, was exemplary. Of course, many people ran away from the explosions, and that's understandable. But a remarkable number of people ran towards the explosions, reportedly even despite the fact that when two bombs go off, you can expect more. Many of these people were professionals. The finish line of a marathon is a convenient place for an explosion, as that's where the doctors, police, ambulances, and so on are located. Some soldiers happened to be on the scene. But others were not professionals."

"VIDEO: On March 30, 2017, drivers in Atlanta on the north side of I-85 found themselves in an astonishing situation when materials stored under the overpass crossing Piedmont Road and Monroe Drive caught fire and the overpass collapsed. Despite the 2017 I-85 bridge collapse that threw Atlanta into a two-month transportation nightmare – or the massive sinkholes that have occurred throughout the city – Georgia's infrastructure is actually one of the best in the country, according to researchers at 24/7 Wall Street, who created an index using the share of potentially hazardous bridges, roads, or dams to determine which states have the worst infrastructure."
"Sanford already has private attorneys. Gerber said he was hired to defend the institution of the governor's office and to help lawmakers realize the seriousness of their discussions. ""The eyes of the world are on South Carolina,"" Gerber said Tuesday, adding that lawmakers' decision on whether to impeach Sanford will have implications for future governors of South Carolina and for the state. Gerber said Sanford's disappearance for five days in June for a secret visit to his lover in Argentina does not meet the high standard required for impeachment. The state constitution says serious crimes or other serious misconduct are the only grounds for impeachment."

""I am striving for a stable peace, based on solid security foundations for the State of Israel and its citizens,"" he said at a cabinet meeting."

"The most likely source worked for the ""Boston Red Sox"" on Sunday. David Ortiz, who never backed away from a big moment, hit a three-run homer off Joba Chamberlain in the ninth inning, giving the ""Red Sox"" a 5-3 win over the ""Detroit Tigers"" at Comerica Park. The win snapped a five-game losing streak for Boston and halted a streak of seven straight series that ended 3-0. Ortiz's heroics, obviously, led the Red Sox to victory. But there was a lot more to Sunday's win, so let's take a look at some notes from the national television event."
"Two mental health advocacy groups want to know which Vermont doctors received thousands of dollars in gifts from pharmaceutical companies last year. The companies may be able to withhold some names under a law protecting trade secrets. The groups argue that this loophole needs to be closed. Last year, doctors and other healthcare providers in Vermont received about $3.1 million in gifts from pharmaceutical companies. Vermont is one of the few states that requires pharmaceutical companies to disclose such marketing expenses. The payments include consulting fees, travel, gifts, and lecture payments."

"Everyone knows where and what they were doing when that nightmare of a story known as 9/11 occurred. Chuck was getting ready for work, and I was sitting at the computer watching FOX when those horrific images appeared. I had the TV on mute, so I only saw flames coming out of one of the towers in New York. I turned on the sound, and the words were incomprehensible. For some reason, even before I knew why and what, tears welled up in my eyes. It's funny how your instincts take over your mind, even before it realizes what's happening."

"Although giant and spectacular circus shows now travel the world, it's worth remembering how they evolved from what was essentially street theatre. This Colombian acrobatic troupe, comprising a dozen young performers presenting the world premiere of their latest show, is one of the main attractions of the now well-established Showzam festival in Blackpool, held during the February half-term week, featuring acts from around the world. Circolombia go on to London after five days of performances here, but nothing will compare to seeing them in the plush surroundings of the big top circus tent, situated at the foot of Blackpool Tower."

Orwell's idea with Newspeak was to create a world where all shades of meaning would be removed from language, which would strengthen the state's total dominance. Naming something with one word when in fact it is its complete opposite can also be an example of Orwellian Newspeak, such as when a bill full of spending on liberal social programs is called a plan for economic stimulus."

"New research shows that mice with induced symptoms similar to Alzheimer's disease showed improved cognitive function when given a synthetic hormone similar to estrogen. ""This synthetic hormone improved behavior roughly as well as estrogen,"" said study leader Christian Pike, an associate professor of gerontology at the University of Southern California. However, unlike estrogen, which thickens the uterus and is a known risk factor for endometrial and breast cancer, the synthetic hormone, called PPT, did not cause visible changes in the animals' reproductive systems. ""This could be a promising strategy for maximizing the benefits of hormone therapy while minimizing its risks,"" Pike said."

"Forget about announcing your latest album with a giant, expensive street concert - Oasis hires street performers to do the heavy lifting of promotion. On Friday, a group of street musicians and performers were assembled to play Oasis' new songs at various locations around Manhattan. This motley crew included violinists, guitarists, and - we can only hope - some of those golden street statues. From subway platforms to park lawns, they played in all five boroughs - even in the pouring rain. Tom and Dominic Di Princippe were among those who got soaked in the rain."
"During her weekly therapy sessions, Julilly shared her most unpleasant secrets: depression, debt, childhood sexual abuse. Her psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital would then type a brief summary into Julilly's computerized medical record. After that, more than 200 pages of confidential notes became available to any doctor who treated her within the vast Partners HealthCare system. She learned about it only when one of the doctors later referred to those notes. Julilly, a 43-year-old lawyer, was first worried, then angry. ""The details are nobody's business,"" she said. But Partners disagrees."
"To engage the private sector in the healthcare system, a significant increase in government investment is indeed required to cover a larger number of people. A new health policy has emerged in the country after 14 years. The very presence of such a long gap indicates the priority, or the lack of it, accorded to a sector that requires urgent attention and has deep linkages with the country's aspiration to grow faster and become a strong economy in the global order. The new policy has proposed seven key changes in the organization of healthcare services, including the desired change from selective primary care to assured comprehensive care with linkages to referral hospitals providing services."

"I've just remembered why I abandoned financial journalism after 11 years in the field, including a stint as a correspondent on Wall Street. Although the world of finance had its appealing aspects, I became increasingly disenchanted with the dominant narrative that always seemed to boil down to money, rather than other factors such as values and social impact, which never seemed to register on the radar. It's not entirely surprising, given the testosterone-fueled trading floors and the fact that there's very little connection between the decisions made by city bosses and their impact on the lives of ordinary people."

"Syria: Why is Assad advancing? In the presidential elections held at the beginning of June, Assad was declared the winner, having gained 88.7% of the vote. This is not surprising, given the nature of the regime. However, despite the fact that these elections were not ""free"" in any way, and that many people were unable to vote because they were in refugee camps outside the country, it turned out that a significant part of the population supports Assad. Why is this so? Stop the criminal attack on Gaza! Yesterday, the Israeli army launched a ground offensive on Gaza."

"BlackBerry has decided not to renew T-Mobile's license to sell its products. This move, which proved unsuccessful last month, led to BlackBerry severing ties with T-Mobile after many years of partnership. BlackBerry announced on Wednesday that it would not renew T-Mobile's license to sell its products when it expires on April 25. T-Mobile had offended the Canadian phone manufacturer in February when it sent a message to its BlackBerry users, offering them an iPhone 5s for $0 down.

"On November 17, 2015, at 12:55 at night.
Michael Höppner had to give up the sophistication of Manhattan's streets. We realized we were paying an arm and a leg for Manhattan. We looked everywhere. In the end, we ended up in this neighborhood, and the houses here are just stunning, and everything seemed much better. The people who sold us this house, Rodney and Desmond, live next door. They already had several offers. I think part of what happened was that they wanted us to be their neighbors: a pregnant couple trying to buy their first home. I'm sure that was probably more appealing than 0.1 percent more on the down payment or something like that."
"Mickey Boodaei has been a leading entrepreneur in the security space for many years. He co-founded Imperva, which went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2011, and co-founded Trusteer, which was acquired by IBM in 2013 for $1 billion. Shortly after the latter acquisition, he founded Transmit Security. Notably, Boodaei did this without taking venture capital, indicating that putting his own money (and that of co-founder Rakesh Loonkar) into the startup felt similar to when he founded his first companies, but in this case, there was no one to report to."

"Can drainage pipes resolve the compacted conflict? How can we get more water into the Republican River? Maybe it's just retrofitting existing pasture dams with the installation of drainage pipes. 8-12 inch diameter pipes would allow rainwater to slowly drain out of the pasture dams and be directed into the Republican River. Note: This solution does not remove any of the pasture dams as they provide us a valuable service, it just retrofits them. The pipes can be installed at a level that allows water to be retained for livestock, wildlife, etc."

"Hull - Where the US goes, the UK often follows, and this is particularly true of negative phenomena. If there is extreme weather in the US, we usually experience similar events within a few days. If violent crime increases on the other side of the ocean, it also increases in the UK. Then there's the shopping riot. The UK has adopted traditional American activities, such as Christmas Eve sales, which leave shoppers with empty wallets and a variety of unnecessary goods. Black Friday has passed, and today is Cyber Monday. Each of these days has become a major shopping day on both sides of the ocean."
"It's been over a decade since Eminem played his sole starring role in the film 8 Mile, and you'd be right to assume that his acting career began and ended there.

The project has now been picked up by The Weinstein Company, and although Eminem is technically still attached, he may be on the verge of being replaced by one of the biggest stars."

""The polls are open! Come on in!"""
"As a veteran of the climate change movement, I had been conditioned to expect disappointment. So when, as the coordinator of Fossil Free Stanford, I was summoned to the office of Stanford's senior assistant president in early May, I approached the meeting with trepidation. There were good reasons for my concern. At the same hour that morning, Harvard University had arrested a student demanding an open dialogue about divesting from fossil fuels. The previous fall, Brown University had flatly refused to meet student demands to cut ties with thirteen of the dirtiest coal companies. Efforts to enact climate policy at the national and international levels had fared no better."

Montana and Exxon-Mobil are at odds over an oil spill. Montana and oil giant Exxon-Mobil are at odds over an oil spill in the Yellowstone River.

"The airline operates 744 mainline aircraft, which vary in size and can carry from 50 to 366 passengers each. For a typical 737 aircraft, which seats 179 passengers, the reduction in fuel consumption would mean a saving of around 11 pounds per flight. According to the article, stopping the sale of duty-free items on board, such as ""liquor, chocolate and perfume"", also allowed for a saving of 1.4 million gallons of fuel per year, which brought United Airlines a saving of $2.3 million. It is likely that this also means that United Airlines was making less than $2.3 million from selling these items on board, or calculated that allowing passengers to buy them on the ground would not have a significant impact on its revenues."
"According to the data presented in the World Economic Forum's ""Global Report on Trade Facilitation 2012"", the country's macroeconomic fundamentals are strong, making it attractive to at least some foreign investors concerned about the euro crisis.

When we do, we've decided to share it and try to answer that question. Photo: Erby Aucoin, The Times-Picayune archive. What it's not: Anything even close to as much fun as these smiles might suggest."
"The yield on U.S. government debt rose on Friday after the U.S. government said job creation in March was stronger than expected, but wages grew at a slow pace. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.538%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond climbed to 2.947%. Bond yields move in the opposite direction of prices. Job creation surged in March after a weak February, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by 196,000, according to a Labor Department report released on Friday. The unemployment rate remained at 3.8%, in line with expectations."
"The Duchess of Sussex's wardrobe may be worth a royal fortune, but yours doesn't have to be. The Meghan Markle effect is in full swing — or perhaps full term. Since the Duchess of Sussex — who is due to give birth to her first child within the next month — announced her pregnancy last autumn, fashion watchers have been scrutinizing her every public move, taking great interest in what she wears and how she wears it. Such scrutiny is nothing new for Markle, whose style has become iconic since she entered the royal scene."
"Trisha Pollard believes that Texas' social services system relies too heavily on the court system to combat Medicaid fraud and not enough on a tool that was handed to her almost nine years ago: background checks. ""It all seems so simple,"" Pollard said on Tuesday. ""People in other areas of life regularly undergo background checks."" The 52-year-old former lawyer stumbled upon the issue last fall when she served on the Harris County grand jury. During her term, Pollard and other grand jury members handed down indictments against two Medicaid providers, each with a criminal history, including involvement in Medicaid fraud."
"Jennifer Garner was spotted out on a stroll with son Samuel! Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck have yet to debut photos of their three-month-old son Samuel, but earlier today Jen stepped out for a walk in Pacific Palisades, California, with her little treasure… which, of course, was all bundled up! The beaming mom took her baby boy to a pediatrician appointment and was all smiles as she pushed him in his stroller. She even leaned in to coo over Samuel, who is undoubtedly just as charming as his big sisters Violet and Seraphina."
"In Yemen, Tunisia, Egypt, and Gaza, demonstrations took place due to an American film that offends the Prophet Muhammad. The film, published on Youtube, which is considered blasphemous, provoked violent protests and attacks on US diplomatic missions in several countries. Here, a Palestinian burns an American flag during demonstrations in Gaza City on September 12. Protesters, outraged by the anti-Islamic film, storm the US embassy in the capital of (***) Yemen. A Libyan holds an English-language placard during a demonstration against the attack on the US consulate, which killed four Americans, including the ambassador, in the city of Benghazi, Libya."
"The Mother New York agency suggests giving mothers command rights instead of flowers or cards. The advertising agency Mother New York suggests making a gift to your mother just in time for Mother's Day. Why not give your mother control over some aspect of your life? The Momtract, which they call ""America's premier legally binding gift"", gives your mother authority over one issue in your life. The Momtract is based on the idea that mothers actually want control, not candy or flowers."
"Zoho offers a total of 43 different applications in its Zoho One cloud suite, but the company has even more projects in the development stage, and it relies heavily on artificial intelligence and a new partnership strategy in individual industries for further growth. PLEASANTON, California - Despite operating in the shadow of larger competitors in the software-as-a-service market, such as Microsoft, Salesforce, and Google, Zoho has managed to ensure impressive customer growth for its renowned Zoho One application suite. The growth from 25 million users last year to over 35 million in a year is notable, as is the fact that Zoho has signed agreements with more than 250,000 companies or organizations as paying customers."
"The spat between American intelligence agencies and the democratically elected President Donald Trump is not only strange but also for this reason is an unusual case for assessing the mandate that should define the relationship between national intelligence and political leadership in a democratic system. Ideally speaking, the national security system based on intelligence performs a sovereign function of detecting and tracking any threat to national security - internal or external - with the aim of neutralizing it in a timely manner. At the same time, however, it does so on the basis of the authority of the elected political leadership, which is the supreme custodian of all sovereign powers in a democracy."
"The Australian men's water polo team came close to pulling off a major upset, losing to three-time defending champions Hungary 10-9 in a classification semifinal and will now play for seventh place on Sunday. As they have shown many times throughout this Olympic campaign, Australia is only a goal or two away from beating the world's best teams on a regular basis. They seriously challenged tournament favorites Serbia in the semifinals before giving up a three-goal lead late in the game, and today they were ahead with five minutes to go."
"The Sparks added the necessary inside strength to their lineup when they completed a three-team trade with the Charlotte Sting and the Sacramento Monarchs. Center Rhonda Mapp and guard I.S. Hill from Charlotte and forward LaTasha Byers from Sacramento joined the Sparks, who sent versatile player Allison Feaster and center Clarissa Machanguana to Charlotte and forward La'Keshia Frett to Sacramento. Forward Rhonda Mapp of the Sparks was suspended from the WNBA and must serve a two-year suspension for violating the league's substance abuse policy, according to a two-paragraph statement released Friday by the league in New York."

Nkoxezwa had taken her own life by hanging herself on curtains in her room at the parliamentary village of Pelican Park in Cape Town on March 20."
"It's a long way from Billings, Mont., to Lincoln, Neb. – anywhere from 850 to 902 miles, depending on which road you take. But that's exactly the journey that a worn and slightly frayed Woody Grant has just embarked upon in the opening scenes of Alexander Payne's new film, the Nebraska native. Payne has been nominated for awards for directing and screenwriting by the organizers of both the Oscars and the Golden Globes, and he has won the gold for screenwriting for the films ""The Descendants"", ""Sideways"", and ""About Schmidt""."
"KENTON, Delaware - a cheese plant in Kenton, shut down by the Food and Drug Administration due to a listeria outbreak, had been inspected 10 times since 2000. A Food and Drug Administration representative stated that during this period, the presence of listeria had never been detected at Roos Food's Inc. facility.

"England have called up uncapped Fulham goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli for matches against Spain and Switzerland, while midfielder Adam Lallana has withdrawn. Bettinelli, 26, was not in Fulham's squad for their first two games of the season but has since regained his place. First-choice goalkeeper Jordan Pickford did not take part in a full England training session on Tuesday. Lallana has returned to Liverpool for assessment on a groin injury.

"The extraordinary mummified remains of a 50-year-old woman, found in a fetal pose, will be exhibited at a museum in France. According to The Independent newspaper, the 1,000-year-old mummy was discovered in 2012 in the ancient Peruvian settlement of Pachacamac near Lima. French archaeologists who discovered the mummy curled up in a fetal pose carefully preserved the integrity of the remains, leaving them in the same position in which they were found. The new exhibition at the Musée des Confluences in Lyon explores various human representations of death across different eras and cultures from around the world."
"Voters in Guernsey are to elect politicians from a single island-wide constituency, rather than the current system of districts. More than half of voters backed the change in the island's first-ever referendum, in which 45% of the electorate took part. Option A - a single island-wide constituency - won with 6,017 votes, making up 52% of the total. This means all 38 Guernsey deputies will be elected by a single vote on the same day every four years, starting in June 2020. More Guernsey stories and the latest referendum news. Deputy and Option A supporter Carl Meerveld said he was ""delighted and relieved""."
"We would also like to hide this list if we were Trump. Is his name really Trump? ""I don't think ISIS would appreciate Acro Cats. I don't think. They're cute and they're silly, two things that ISIS hates. In fact, the only thing they have in common is that they're all cats."" One of the costumes reminded Colbert of an acid trip. We'll take one of each. The CEO of Uber made his first appearance on Stephen Colbert's new show 'Late Show', but it was far from a smooth ride."

On Thursday, LightSquared and the Technical Working Group (TWG), established by the FCC and comprising representatives from industries that rely on GPS and LightSquared, presented their final arguments for and against LightSquared's $7 billion proposal."

The event is organized by the China Cultural Media group."
"The central element of the reconstruction is a warehouse built in 1943, according to the date scribbled on the concrete. It's made of wood. The roof leaks. There's no air conditioning, let alone a cold storage for fresh fruits and vegetables. The warehouse should have been demolished a long time ago. But those who work at the Powerello house continued to work as always, making do with very little. When it rains, water pours inside. Extreme temperatures spoil our food. And this creates serious problems with pest control."
"Delicious, the original social bookmarking king of the internet, is now in the hands of YouTube's founders, after a popular protest saved it from being shut down by Yahoo. Chad Hurley and Steve Chen, who sold YouTube to Google for $1.65 billion in 2006, will integrate Delicious into their new company AVOS and will start running Delicious in July.

""I told him I know I've done all I could. I feel good about the 29 years I spent with the Cowboys. But it's a bad way to end."
"There are plenty of reasons to be skeptical about the ""smart home"" in its current form, but Amazon's virtual assistant Echo shows glimpses of real potential. Here's why. I roll my eyes at the concept of a ""smart"" refrigerator. I don't need my fridge to tweet to tell me I'm out of jam. A ""smart"" toaster? I mock it. And ""smart"" locks on your front door seem like a particularly silly idea - unless you're eager for company from thieves. I get why you might want a ""smart"" thermostat, like Nest, but the hype surrounding it may be overblown."

"It was a situation that baffled many people around the world, not to mention the passengers on board the British Airways plane. Yesterday, a British Airways plane that was supposed to fly from London to Düsseldorf landed in Edinburgh by mistake after the pilots were given the wrong flight plan. Flight BA3271 was operated by German company WDL Aviation - which was responsible for the plane and the cabin crew - on behalf of BA as part of a leasing agreement. One possibility, it is believed, is that on Sunday the plane had already flown to Edinburgh and back on a previous flight, and so the same flight plan was repeated again on Monday morning."
"Two members of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians pleaded guilty to murder in the early hours of November 2.

Finally warmed up, he boarded the bus on Wednesday evening with a backpack full of supplies and a pocket full of money from the kind residents of Troy."
"The Saturday night game was an exact replica of the Friday night game for the Amarillo Bulls in terms of score and outcome, and if they play another game like that, they will have no more games. For the second time in as many nights at the Amarillo Civic Center Coliseum, the Bulls eventually fell to the Corpus Christi IceRays. This time it was in overtime as Corpus Christi's Kyle Moore scored 77 seconds into the extra period, giving the Bulls a 6-5 loss in the South Division semifinals of the North American Hockey League."

"Maenga is disappointed with your press release against the apology statement by UTM president Saulos Chilima. If you think Malawi is still living in the past where your police lie to the country that Robert Chasowa committed suicide when in fact your party killed him, you are deeply mistaken. Malawi today is not ready to tolerate nonsense. A few weeks ago when your party was terrorizing the nation, your president Peter Mutharika could not utter a word. Under pressure, President Mgeme Kalirani was tasked to release a statement which did not meet the nation's expectations. Up to now, your government has not revealed the identity of the terrorists nor arrested them."
"The taxi-hailing service is returning to Taiwan with an updated business model that claims it will comply with local regulations this time around. Uber suspended its services in Taiwan two months ago, but plans to resume them this Thursday. It appears that Uber is unstoppable, and Taiwan has just found that out.

There were no reports of injuries among firefighters."
"With the economy starting to slow, Ben Bernanke's war on the nation's savers continues. Some of these funds are even paying juicy double-digit yields - like the one my Permanent Wealth Investor subscribers earned 20% over two years. Dividend capture funds: these funds buy stocks of companies that are about to pay a dividend, and then sell the stocks after the dividend is paid. By doing so, they can switch between companies with different pay dates, thereby achieving a high dividend payout. The problem is that the stock usually trades lower after the dividend is paid, by the amount of the dividend."

"This opens the way for credit agencies to charge higher fees for overdue loans. According to an analysis published on Tuesday by the Consumer Federation of America (CFA), millions of Americans are behind on student loan payments. Data obtained from the US Department of Education shows that 42.4 million people in the US had $1.3 trillion in federal student debt by the end of 2016. Since 2013, the average debt per borrower has increased by 17 percent.

"DENVER (AP) — The nonpartisan administrator of the Colorado state Senate has warned staff, aides, and interns that policy prohibits them from talking to journalists about workplace issues — including sexual harassment. KUNC-FM reported Tuesday that Senate Secretary Effie Ameen sent two emails reminding workers that giving interviews to journalists is a violation of the chamber's policy. Ameen sent the emails in February and March, when Republican leadership in the Senate insisted that complaints of misconduct and harassment by lawmakers in the workplace should either be handled confidentially — in accordance with the legislative body's workplace harassment policy — or referred to law enforcement."
"It was a Saturday morning, August. I remember it very vividly. I was on the internet, sitting in bed, browsing, not looking for anything in particular. One article caught my attention: it was an article about the refugee crisis. Men, women, and children were risking their lives to get to Western Europe, and many were dying in the process. It was a story of resilience and horrific trauma. In response, I expected compassion, an outburst of solidarity. But my heart sank as I read the comments. There was so much cruelty."
"A Central American referee, Carlos Batres, fell for the worst World Cup simulation by the most theatrical Italian since Federico Fellini, thereby depriving the New Zealand ""All Whites"" of a famous victory over the reigning world football champions. The scenes were reminiscent of Australia's defeat by Italy at the 2006 World Cup, when ten Italian players managed to score a penalty in injury time after Fabio Grosso fell following a collision with defender Lucas Neill. Fabio Grosso falls after being hit by defender Lucas Neill at the 2006 World Cup. Don't be fooled - Italy, four-time world champions, did not fairly earn their way back into the game."

"The traditionally conservative Michelin guide, marking its 100th anniversary and a new, slimmer look for its mascot, Bibendum, was generous with stars in France and Switzerland this year. On March 2, three French restaurants were elevated to the highest level in the rating, three stars. Hélène Darroze's restaurant in Paris and Alain Ducasse's Louis XV restaurant in Monte Carlo regained their third star, which they had lost the previous year, giving Mr. Ducasse a total of six stars; his second three-star restaurant in Paris also bears his name. Pierre Gagnaire, whose restaurant also bears his name, regained his third star, which he had lost two years ago when he moved from St-Etienne to Paris."
"He looked the part in jeans and with his muscles toned. Many fans believe the nickname was an unpleasant consequence of his success at the time. On Tuesday, November 14, the real Rambo visited Springsteen backstage after Springsteen's Broadway performance. Sylvester Stallone posted two entries about it on Instagram. The first is a photo of Springsteen, Stallone, and actor Benicio del Toro, the second is a short film in which Springsteen bows to the audience at the end of the show, and the camera moves to a smiling and applauding Stallone in the hall. ""We went backstage and spent some time with his wonderful family."
"The internet has changed more in the last five years than anyone could have assumed. It is no longer just a means for browsing: it is filled with Web 2.0 applications, real-time tasks, and a whole range of threats designed to exploit this new usage model. As a result, web security has changed incredibly - it is no longer enough to just block, stop, or restrict IP sessions. Web filtering alone cannot solve the security problem. This webinar will explain how internet traffic has changed and how your IT perceptions may not match what your users are actually doing, leading to your security measures being ineffective."
"The fourth episode of Aaron Sorkin's series ""The Newsroom"" is titled ""I'll Try to Fix You"". This can be considered the title of the entire series. Like Sorkin's ""The West Wing"", the show wants to fix America, this time through the story of Will McAvoy (Jeff Daniels), a successful, cynical, and boring cable news anchor who decides that he, and journalism, and yes, democracy, can do better. What does this mean? Will's producer and ex-girlfriend MacKenzie McHale (Emily Mortimer) explains: ""Restoring the fourth estate""."
"The Israeli ambassador and nearly all staff were evacuated from the country's embassy in Jordan's capital Amman amid growing concerns of an attack on the diplomatic mission similar to last year's attack in Egypt. Fears of violent anti-Israeli protests similar to those that erupted in Cairo were sparked by calls for a ""million-man march"" on the Israeli embassy in Amman. The action, planned for Thursday, was organized via Facebook. The slogan ""No Zionist embassy on Jordanian territory"" was posted online earlier this week and has already attracted thousands of pledges to attend the demonstration."
"The Maine State Lottery has selected Fuseideas as its advertising agency, an account that was previously handled by NL Partners of Portland, Maine.

"My daughter, a resident advisor at her college, recently groaned, mentioning that she would probably have to oversee additional exchange students this fall semester. When I asked why that was bad, she said that exchange students tend to assume Americans are stupid unless proven otherwise. They think Americans haven't traveled as much, or aren't as fluent in foreign languages, or aren't as knowledgeable about world culture. I said what any good American would say: Why don't they just stay home, then? Oh, she replied, they don't think our college is stupid."
"Several students had what can be politely referred to as a ""disagreement"" at Graham Middle School. Kim Davis, one of the school counselors, remains calm and composed, helping to resolve the issue. This is the kind of situation that counselors face all the time in Alamance County, North Carolina, and across the United States. Davis' determination to do this part of her job well, as well as launch efforts to help students succeed in middle school, has earned her national recognition. She became a national semi-finalist for the 2013 School Counselor of the Year award from the American School Counselor Association, receiving the award earlier this month."
"I strongly urge the mayor and council to continue to preserve the South Central Corridor. This is the only solution that will preserve the will of the voters without jeopardizing Federal Transportation Administration grant funding and enhance the value of light rail in Phoenix. Our leaders need to stay the course and support this vital project. This is the only reasonable course of action. In Arizona, all necessary medical specialties are already licensed to provide patients with a comprehensive approach to addressing chronic pain. It's time for medical specialists to work together in the best interests of our patients."
"GREENSBORO, USA -- Representatives of the Piedmont Triad International Airport announced on Thursday that Allegiant Air will begin new, non-stop, budget air service from PTI to the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.

"A local state representative is calling for a fundamental reform of the state's standardized testing system after a ""litany of errors"" that he believes impacted the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR) in 2016. Isaac believes that school districts should have the option to choose from national standardized tests while the state fixes the STAAR test. When the STAAR was last administered in May, issues arose with test administration, as well as loss or late delivery of testing materials, glitches that invalidated test results, and breaches of student private information, according to a press release."

The Abortion Supervisory Committee of New Zealand has appealed a High Court judge's decision that there are grounds to believe that many abortions in the country are illegal. A certified consultant may lawfully authorize an abortion in New Zealand only if they act on the basis of a certificate approved by two consultants appointed by the Abortion Supervisory Committee. The appeal also claims that the court erred in a matter of law in concluding that the committee may form its own opinion on the legality of consultants' decisions to approve or decline an abortion.
"FOXBORO - The football team ""Camelot"" extends its undefeated streak (17-0) in the new year, just one step away from appearing in its fourth Super Bowl in the last seven seasons. The New England Patriots advanced to the AFC Championship game by defeating the Jacksonville Jaguars 31-20 at Gillette Stadium last night. In a week from today, Bill Belichick's ""Historic boys"" will play either the San Diego Chargers or the Indianapolis Colts in Foxboro for the right to appear in Super Bowl XLII in Arizona on February 3. ""We played well enough to win,"" said Belichick. ""Each stage of the playoffs gets tougher and tougher."""
"Johnny Depp has broken his silence about his scandalous involvement in the film ""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald"". Depp has been in his own world for some time now, which has led to very public scandals. The actor was accused of domestic violence by his ex-wife Amber Heard, which was very poorly received by Harry Potter fans. The fact that the producers and J.K. Rowling left him in the film left many fans disappointed. When asked about the scandal surrounding his involvement in ""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald"", Johnny Depp did not shy away from answering and responded to it."
"RICH CARLGARD: You have to look at four areas. One of them is financial regulations, which still make it difficult for small business to get credit. You have healthcare regulations, which you mentioned, Obamacare adds a burden of costs everywhere you look, around every corner. You have environmental regulations, and that's a whole area that's killing small business, especially where I live, in California. California farmers are going bankrupt over the protection of certain insects. Then you have labor regulations. Last year we witnessed the National Labor Relations Board's war against Boeing."
"To provoke ""sabotage"", foreign actors struck key power plants in the country, which ""had equipment made in Canada"", explained Maria Zakharova, adding that the perpetrators were well aware of ""all the algorithms and vulnerabilities"" of Venezuela's energy system. Venezuela began to suffer from nationwide power outages last week. President Nicolas Maduro called the outages ""sabotage"" organized by the US. He stated that several ""saboteurs"" had been detained while trying to interfere with the energy system. Earlier, he accused Washington of plotting to overthrow him, as well as other alleged subversive actions."
"Where were you when you received the 40 Under 40 award? It was 2009, and I had already been working at Grubb & Ellis for nine years. In retrospect, I was a young professional still honing my craft in commercial real estate, developing my expertise, and refining the client service process. What was your most significant accomplishment after receiving the award? Although I appreciate the recognition as one of the top producers within the company or in the local market and have achieved a high volume of transactions annually, I am most proud of my successes on behalf of my clients."

"The budget crisis facing the Palestinian government is deepening after the Islamic resistance group Hamas won elections last week. On Thursday, the Palestinian Authority (PA) announced that it is delaying the payment of January salaries to 137,000 government employees by at least two weeks due to post-election budget woes. The PA needs $116 million to cover the monthly payroll. However, following Hamas' victory in last week's elections, Israel said it is withholding its monthly tax transfers to the PA, which amount to around $45 million, until further notice."

"Moving to modern times, mobile game tool developer Corona Labs acquired cloud-based mobile services startup Game Minion. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. Corona has one of the most popular software development kits for mobile games, with more than 200,000 users. But the acquisition will help speed up app creation for all developers, according to the two companies. Game Minion's services will be rebranded as Corona Cloud.

"The trustees of Settle's Victoria Hall were celebrating this week after learning they are to receive a grant of more than £200,000 to help with its restoration. It was announced on Wednesday that the Victoria Hall company in Settle will receive a £201,500 grant to restore the old music hall. Without the grant, many people had feared the building would fall into disrepair and close. A start date for the restoration work has now been scheduled for July 31. The plans include an extension to give the building a new lease of life as a community centre and theatre."
"Japanese manufacturer Mitsubishi is set to make its first major foray into the full-size minivan market this summer with a stylish and distinctive new people carrier called the Grandis. Although it's not due to arrive here until July, the British importer has revealed pricing information at a very early stage. Full specifications and prices have been announced more than three months ahead of the launch in the obvious hope that anyone considering buying a rival minivan such as the Peugeot 807, Chrysler Voyager or Ford Galaxy will wait to see what the Grandis has to offer."
"This cozy home is located at the end of a cul-de-sac, situated at the highest point of Fairfield Glade. It offers 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms with tile or laminate flooring throughout the house. The master bathroom features a sink and a tile shower. The home also offers a galley kitchen with a separate dining room adjacent to the kitchen.

"In last June, the Tacoma Rainiers team brought a deer mascot Rubarb and a local celebrity ""Epic Saxophonist Goliath"" to the roof of the Cheney Stadium, where the top league club performs, to carry out a usual stunt intended to delight the crowd. Also on the roof was the Tacoma News Tribune columnist Matt Driscoll, who recently explained how the rooftop dances brought his employer and the baseball club thousands of dollars in fines from the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries. But somewhere in the pile of public documents that I eventually obtained, one letter - from one person - helped provide a more complete answer."
"Recently, my elderly mother visited her bank located in the Eastland Shopping Center in West Covina. As she was leaving, a woman with a baby approached her and asked for money to feed the child, stating that she had recently arrived from Italy and had no money or means of support. As is often the case with elderly people I've known, she didn't hesitate and gave the woman five dollars. With her kind heart, my mom asked her about all the details of this sad story. The woman thanked her and moved on to other people in the parking lot."
"Jaiprakash Hospital is undergoing cosmetic renovations lately, the walls of the wards have been whitewashed, the walls have been painted, etc. New facilities are also being added to the hospital. The outpatient department, pediatric department, women's department, and other hospital premises have been renovated and have a new look. Next in line for renovation is the upper floor of the hospital. The amount allocated by the state government for the expansion of the hospital is being used for the renovation. Additionally, 18 lakh rupees have been allocated for further improvement of the hospital."
"Can faith be taxed? This is the question being asked by churchgoers as the tradition of tithing - giving 10% of one's income to the church - is increasingly being called into question. Opponents of tithing argue that it is a misinterpretation of the Bible, something made up by people rather than given by God. They believe they should be free to donate any amount of their choice, and they argue with pastors, write letters, and leave congregations in protest. In response, some pastors have changed their teachings and abandoned what had been a beloved method of fundraising for decades."
"The tide is changing at Frankston, and the Dolphins have recorded back-to-back wins for the first time in almost six years, achieving a 13-point victory over Collingwood at Victoria Park on Saturday. Coach Simon Goosey had a five-year plan to turn the boys into finals contenders, and the results are evident. Frankston beat last year's preliminary finalist Port Melbourne last week and contained a fast-finishing Pease on Saturday. The key, Goosey said, was that players had been drafted into the AFL system. Michael Hibberd, Dylan Van Unen, and Mark Baguley are at Essendon, and Marcus Marigliani was on the Bombers' list in 2011."
"The sad demise of veteran Indian film actor Kader Khan has left a void in the Hindi film industry that cannot be filled. Condolences have been pouring in for the late actor and his grieving family since the news broke. The actor, who passed away in a hospital in Canada, was remembered at his funeral, which recently took place in Canada. On Wednesday, family members and fans of the actor gathered in Toronto to pay their last respects. At Kader Khan's funeral in Toronto, Canada, the actor's son Sarfaraz thanked everyone for coming and going through this difficult journey."
"Will Chelsea change their tactics for the match against Arsenal? Judging by body language, you would never have thought Chelsea were just two points off the top of the Premier League. After the defeat by Sunderland in the League Cup quarter-final on Wednesday, Jose Mourinho looked drained, a strange mix of irritability, tiredness and determination. ""We maybe have to take a step back to become more consistent in our defensive phase,"" he said. ""That's what I don't want to do, to play more on the counter-attack, but I'm thinking seriously about it."
"TOKYO (AFP) - Nearly half of Tokyo's residents were unable to name a single Paralympian, and international sports officials are worried about the city's readiness to host athletes. With the 2020 Olympics looming, the Japanese capital has work to do. ""If the Paralympics are not successful, the Tokyo Games will not be successful,"" Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said in a recent interview with AFP. So, to fill the stadiums, Tokyo has set about upgrading its infrastructure, making its metro system accessible to people with disabilities and urging hotels to check their accessibility for wheelchair users."
"Four-term Governor Terry Branstad is set to officially begin his fifth term today. Branstad, a Republican, left office in January 1999 after 16 years of serving as governor. In October 2009, Branstad stepped down as president of Des Moines University, the state's largest medical school, and launched what he called a ""comeback"" bid for governor. Branstad is to take the oath of office at a ceremony at about 10:15 a.m. Branstad told a group of journalists and editors last week that his wife, Chris, had urged him not to give a long and boring speech."
"The bride and groom in Canada spent their first night of marital bliss behind bars after their wedding party escalated into a bar fight. A violent brawl between men and women erupted at the Denizen Hall in downtown Edmonton just 15 minutes after the group arrived at the establishment, according to witnesses.

"A man has been jailed for keeping dogs for fighting at his home in Ayrshire. Tony Barbara, 50, was found guilty of keeping two pitbull-type terriers for use in fights, despite being subject to a 10-year ban on keeping the animals. At Kilmarnock Sheriff Court, the case was heard that animal welfare officials and police had searched Barbara's home on High Street in Newmilns, East Ayrshire, on November 12, 2014, after receiving a tip-off. Officers found two dogs with stab wounds and scars. The animals, named Kyra and Jackie, were being kept in cages in the kitchen and a bedroom."
"SANTA MARIA, Brazil – Large beach balls, sized for a group known for its pyrotechnic stage shows, may have cost more than 230 people their lives at a nightclub in southern Brazil, according to a statement by a state police inspector leading the investigation into the deadly fire that occurred over the weekend. Inspector Marcelo Arigony told journalists at a press conference on Tuesday that the band members intentionally purchased fireworks meant for outdoor use because they cost just $1.25 each, compared to $35 for an indoor firework. ""The lit fireworks were meant for outdoor use only, and the people who lit them knew that"", Arigony said."
"Indeed, by Sunday the temperature should return to the 50s, and then possibly reach the upper 70s by January 10. But first, the National Weather Service forecasts mostly sunny skies and a high of 59 degrees on Tuesday. The front will move into Fort Worth by mid-day, but its effects will likely only be felt during the overnight hours, leading to a rather chilly wake-up on Wednesday with temperatures hovering just above freezing. The high on Wednesday is forecast to be 46 degrees with partly cloudy skies, followed by a low of 28 degrees."
"Numerous bills in the New Jersey State General Assembly are of interest to truckers and other road users across the state. Repeat offenders who commit the crime of driving under the influence may soon face harsher punishments for their actions. Currently, New Jersey state law limits the punishment for affected offenders to a disorderly persons offense, typically carrying a $2,500 bail. The designation of a disorderly persons offense allows drivers charged with drunk driving to continue operating a vehicle until their court date. A bill currently before the Assembly would put an end to this practice. Instead, A3057 would increase the punishment for a person convicted of drunk driving two or more times within 60 days to a fourth-degree crime."
"Lord of the Rings star Liv Tyler took a stroll with her husband. The Hollywood star couldn't hide her smile as she watched the racing on the second day of the festival in Cheltenham on March 15. Dressed all in black, the mother of three shone brightly as she peered through binoculars to enjoy the races. The stunning brunette wore a black silk dress that fell just above the ankles, with a butterfly motif on the cuffs and a belt around the waist. She added a wide-brimmed black hat and clutched a small black clutch with a floral pattern in her hand on Ladies' Day at the festival."
"Why is a fiery Dutch journalist on the payroll of the former Alaska governor's political action committee? A Mother Jones investigation. In recent months, Sarah Palin's political action committee, SarahPAC, has paid out thousands of dollars to a mysterious company that has gone to great lengths to conceal its ownership. The addresses associated with the company lead to post office boxes. It has no website. No phone number. Even the California lawyer who incorporated the company didn't know who was behind it. But a Mother Jones investigation has found that the company is managed by an unlikely foreign political figure."
"Carillon Beach's organic lifestyle comes naturally to Lea and Andy Meyer, and their market and Sunrise Cafe is just an extension of that lifestyle. ""I love how everyone is so friendly here. The culture here is really interesting. And I love the beaches and the sunshine,"" Lea said on Thursday, making pancakes from scratch at the cafe. She and Andy relocated from the Northern California area to Seaside in February. The Meyers fell in love with the Carillon Beach community, opening the cafe on March 21, and then organizing the Carillon Beach Farmers' Market this summer."
"The Bible teaches: ""Resist the devil, and he will flee from you"" (James 4:7). It also tells us to turn away from those who are controlled by various lusts (see 1 Tim. 3:5-6). Many great men of God have given in to fleshly temptations and potentially ruined their lives and ministries. One person said: ""It takes a lifetime to build integrity, and only a minute to lose it."" This is a true saying! I believe that one of the most important reasons for the fall of leaders is that most of them never intentionally built psychological and emotional defensive barriers."
"Former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke was sentenced on Friday to six years and nine months for the murder of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, more than four years after the shooting. Jason Van Dyke, a former Chicago police officer whose fatal shooting of a black teenager, Laquan McDonald, in 2014 rekindled heated national debates about police shootings, was sentenced on Friday to six years and nine months in prison. The veteran officer was convicted in October of second-degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery with a firearm for the October 2014 shooting. The shooting and its video sparked protests across Chicago and calls for Van Dyke to receive serious prison time."
"Did Led Zeppelin steal from 1960s band Spirit? And did ""The Voice"" steal from ""American Idol""? A recent lawsuit by the heirs of the composer of ""Taurus"" claims that ""Stairway To Heaven"" infringes on copyright laws. Creative people have been borrowing from each other for centuries. But what constitutes real harm - business, artistic, or otherwise? How much original art has been transferred into a new work? That's always the murkiest part. Music copyright infringement lawsuits have been going on for over a century."
"A detailed process of updating, I hope it can be useful to you if you don't have such experience before. Let me take care of the back and unscrew the screws. Be careful, the keyboard is connected to the blue connector, carefully pull it out! Take the back again and start unscrewing the screws in a row. Pull out the back bracket. Now start replacing the SSD. Okay. It fits perfectly into the slot. Assemble the screws so they fit the SSD. Evaluate the SSD rating, surprised me again, 7.8 points. As far as I know, the highest rating is 7.9."
"Being optimistic about their first housing project in Cavite, Century Properties Group Inc. (CPG) and Mitsubishi Corp. signed an agreement on Wednesday to form a new joint venture that will bring to the real estate market affordable homes worth around 57 billion pesos over the next five years. Aiming to address part of the country's huge deficit of 6.6 million housing units, the new venture plans to launch around 15 new housing projects, equivalent to about 33,000 housing units, over the next five years. Each unit will cost between 1 million and 6 million pesos, targeting first-time middle-class buyers."

After two high-scoring games in Kansas City, Game 3 of the World Series turned into a more subdued pitchers' duel when the Royals won in San Francisco. The Royals' first baseman, Eric Hosmer, celebrates after Hunter Pence of the Giants was thrown out, ending Game 3 of the World Series on Friday. Game 3 of the World Series turned into a bullpen showdown on Friday, as eight relievers struck out nine over 7 1/3 scoreless innings for the Giants and Royals."

The man, described as heavyset and aged 30-40, stole a 9-carat white gold ring with a diamond, an 18-carat white gold ring, and a 19-carat white gold ring with diamonds."
"Jeremy Tucker is leaving his top marketing position at Nissan North America to ""pursue other opportunities"", according to the automaker. An informed source claims that Tucker, who held the position of vice president of marketing communications and media at Nissan, was fired. However, Tucker describes it as a ""mutually agreed upon departure"". The automaker's sales have been lackluster, and there has been some discontent among dealers due to the lack of national brand advertising, according to another source. The automaker's total US sales for calendar year 2018 were down 6.2% compared to the previous year."

"Below is a text by Katrine Eggers Jensen, one of the founding editors of EuropeNow, a publication dedicated to political research, literature, and art at Columbia University. Previously, she held the position of Editor-in-Chief of the Columbia Journal and blog editor at Asymptote and Words Without Borders. If Edgar Allan Poe were alive to read the works of Alejandra Pizarnik, it would have given him nightmares. Pizarnik is revered by writers such as Octavio Paz, Roberto Bolaño, and César Aira, the latter of whom called her the ""greatest and last"" poet, and she is one of the most important figures in 20th-century Argentine poetry."
"Albion striker Simon Cox has become a target for Championship club Derby County. Rams boss Nigel Clough is keeping a close eye on the 23-year-old and will consider a loan deal if he gets any encouragement from The Hawthorns. Sources in the East Midlands have confirmed today that the former Reading and Swindon player is on a list of forwards being tracked by Clough, who is keen to strengthen his attacking options. The Pride Park boss is also interested in highly-rated Gary Hooper from Scunthorpe, Billy Sharp from Sheffield United and James Vaughan from Everton, who he signed on loan last season."
"Ken Block creates amazing gymkhana videos. But the New South Wales police didn't want Ken Block to film this particular gymkhana video - the one you see right there - in Sydney. So the Hoonigan team went to New York instead, leaving Australia in the dust. Here's the video they made - a video that could have included the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Opera House and all of our city's most famous landmarks. Ken Block's Gymkhana Nine was filmed in conjunction with the launch of Forza Horizon 3, which is set in Australia - so it made sense to film Gymkhana Nine in Australia."
"Rawalpindi: The Montessori and High School students of the Sadeeqa’s Learning System (SLS) marked the Autism Awareness Day, says a press release. The senior school on Harley Street organised a special assembly to raise awareness among the students about autistic disorder, highlighting its causes, symptoms and coping strategies.

"ANSWER: I will reduce property taxes. We pay the highest property taxes in the US. I have already lowered property taxes at the local level. I will repeal the income tax hike. Families are struggling to make ends meet. My opponent just raised their income tax by 32%. I will preserve necessary services for those who truly need them. We will end the corrupt one-party system of Madigan. ANSWER: All new and recent hires into 401k plans. Raise the age at which you can collect a pension, except for police and firefighters. Change the annual cost of living adjustment from the current 3% to the Consumer Price Index (CPI)."
"The images we've published from Yemen are as disturbing as any we've used before. That's why we've chosen to publish them. Amal Hussein is a 7-year-old Yemeni girl with a haunting gaze, whose image appears at the beginning of our latest report from Yemen, a country wracked by war and on the brink of catastrophic famine. Amal is skin and bones, and her head is turned to the side, as if she cannot bear the gaze of those looking at her. Some readers may also feel the urge to look away."
"Ballinhassig 4-17 Castlelyons 1-12: A polished second-half display enabled Ballinhassig to record a convincing win over Castlelyons in the Cork Premier League hurling championship quarter-final on Saturday evening. Inspired by Danny O'Callaghan and with five members of the Cork intermediate hurling panel on board, the Carrigdhoun side showed many qualities that could facilitate a swift return to the top tier. While the focus will be on the forwards, it was the industry of O'Callaghan and the solidity of the Blues' half-back line that launched their surge in the second half and yielded 2-11 (2-10 from play) on the scoreboard."
"US trade policy has become a top concern among financial directors, according to a quarterly CNBC survey. Approximately two-thirds of financial directors from North America and the Asia-Pacific region believe that US trade policy will have a negative impact on their company over the next six months. Seven of the 16 largest declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average this year have been driven by trade issues. US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin arrived on Capitol Hill on Thursday to answer questions about trade, tariffs, and NAFTA before the House Financial Services Committee. Mnuchin attempted to alleviate growing uncertainty in Congress as President Trump escalates the trade war with China."
"January 29, 2015: Follow the money. One of the reasons the new peace talks are yielding results is that the factions responsible for large segments of the population are willing to compromise if it will help stop the accelerating decline in the standard of living across the country. Economic activity is shrinking, and shortages are increasing due to inter-factional fighting, and especially because two governments are claiming to run the entire country. Then there is all the Islamic terrorist activity. While most Libyans appreciated the help of Islamic terrorist groups in overthrowing Gaddafi in 2011, since then these groups have become more of a threat than Gaddafi's secret police ever were."
"What exactly sets people apart from machines? In fact, two things: creativity and empathy. Regardless of what is being developed in the field of AI, these two elements can preserve the business of agency services and keep marketers busy for years to come. AI is a complement to what you do, it is designed to enhance your capabilities. AI can create a layer of efficiency that would otherwise be lacking in companies, and free them up to do work with greater impact. Agencies have been successful in the past because they were creative."

"A police officer was dismissed from the force for his behaviour towards his partner during their relationship. A Northamptonshire police officer who choked his girlfriend in her bedroom and told her he would ""kill her"" has been sacked from the force. It took a year for the police officer Greg Mead's former partner to go to the police to report her experience of being in a relationship with him in 2018 and early 2019. However, at a police misconduct hearing, the 28-year-old woman told panel members how Mr Mead lost his temper and became violent during their time together."
"LL Cool J became the first rapper to receive the prestigious Kennedy Center award last week, in a ceremony that also recognized the contributions of Gloria Estefan and Lionel Richie.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington."
"Narendra Modi's selective problem: creating jobs. Lots of them. The Indian government's failure to create millions of new jobs for its young population could be the reason for its election defeat. Aasihk Ahmed Iqbal had no reason to believe he wouldn't be able to find a job. Although he came from a humble family, he studied at one of India's top schools, attended one of the country's top universities, and earned a PhD in history from Oxford University after receiving a highly competitive scholarship. When he returned to India in 2017, he was optimistic about finding a job as an academic."

"The Russian data center market continues to grow. It is enough to look at the significant growth of commissioned facilities to find evidence of this. Consumers are no longer impressed by data centers with an area of several thousand square meters, containing 1000 or more racks - this has become a common thing. According to data provided by Datacenter Dynamics, over the past two years, the Russian data center market has outpaced India, China, and Brazil in terms of total investment. Similarly, based on recent construction data for the same period, Russia ranks second after Brazil among the BRICS countries in terms of total area."

The app has already been demonstrated to the Chinese government; the final version may be launched within the next six to nine months, depending on approval from Chinese officials.

The most obvious and frightening issue is that some malicious version of Dragonfly could be imposed on Google's and Android's domestic users."

"The primary task of North Korea's junior minister for re-education is to refute everything French intellectuals have ever said. In one year, he released a special issue on Jean-Paul Sartre and started with Sartre's assertion that ""Three o'clock is always too early or too late for what you want to do"". Since it was a sleepy Friday, the junior minister just made a quick call and renamed his local football team to Sports Club 4:25. This made Sartre look very foolish, because the club plays all its matches at 4:25 PM. In fact, every time they play, their fans chant ""Look, Jean-Paul Sartre?"""
