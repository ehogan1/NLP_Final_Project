"The girl on the threshold returns, and our main characters are in very interesting relationships. Cecilia and Schmidt have finally tied themselves with the bonds of marriage. Nick is in a relatively new romance with Reagan, and Winston is actually dating Eli. So, what exactly should we expect? Here are six things that excite us the most this season. 1. We'll see more of Reagan. If you enjoyed Megan Fox's appearance in New Girl last season, then you should be happy that she's back."

"A voter scam has been confirmed in several states, including Mississippi. Louisiana's chief election official is warning residents about a potential scam targeting people to get their personal info after similar issues in several other states. The scam involves a caller claiming to work for a voter registration organization. The callers offer to register residents over the phone and in some cases, mail the voter an absentee ballot, said Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin. According to state law, residents cannot register to vote or request an absentee ballot over the phone."
"For small businesses that sell on credit, accounts receivable can make up a significant portion of the balance sheet. During the annual audit, auditors will check if your claims about accounts receivable balance can be proven. These claims are known as assertions. The most common audit procedure related to accounts receivable is confirmation, where the auditor will ask your customers to confirm their account balance. Knowing which assertions can be proven through confirmation can help you understand why your auditor requires several audit procedures for the same account. Accounts receivable confirmations are primarily used to prove the existence assertion."
"Rejoice that you're not Jim Furyk today. 1. The American team came out on Sunday with a huge four-point advantage in the Ryder Cup, and the local fans were expecting to enjoy another dominant day. 2. Luke Donald won the first match of the day against Bubba Watson, making the score 10-7. Nevertheless, the US has a big advantage. However. 3. Europe's Paul Lawrie completely outplayed Brandt Snedeker, earning another point for Europe. 4. At least Keegan Bradley, the best player on the US team all weekend, was putting up a good fight against Rory McIlroy."
"It happens: you hit the snooze button once, twice, and then three times, so by the time you finally take a shower, get dressed, and are ready to tackle the day, you're already behind schedule. Often, this causes you to skip breakfast altogether. It turns out, your breakfast habit is one of the time-saving steps that shouldn't be skipped. Firstly, consuming a nutritious, high-protein, and balanced breakfast every morning is a proven way to kickstart your brain, improving focus and productivity. Additionally, breakfast is associated with better weight control, as it provides your body with energy and can reduce hunger later in the day."
"Dublin: Lawmakers voted overwhelmingly on Friday to support Ireland's first abortion bill, legalizing the practice in exceptional cases where doctors deem a woman's life to be at risk due to pregnancy, thereby taking the predominantly Catholic country's first legislative step away from a total ban. Weary lawmakers applauded the Friday vote of 127-31, while outside parliament gates, abortion rights activists cheered, watching the result on their smartphones. It marked the culmination of grueling debates that had lawmakers at odds from Wednesday morning until 5 am Thursday and, after a sleep break, until midnight Friday."
"The best Halloween costumes are inspired by the most memorable moments of the year, and 2016 was no exception. We had the Summer Olympics and the US presidential election, which take over the front pages of newspapers (and Facebook feeds!) every four years. Add to that Beyoncé's visually stunning album, the Pokémon Go frenzy, and the colorful, quotable madness of the movie ""Suicide Squad"", and 2016 was practically begging for a Halloween costume boom. We've become experts in all things Halloween — producing content that's been viewed over a billion times. That's where we come in."

"VOLGOGRAD/GELENDZHIK, Russia (Reuters) - Iceland will try not to melt in the heat of Volgograd when they play Nigeria in only their second World Cup match on Friday after impressively drawing with twice- champions Argentina at the weekend. World Cup debutants Iceland are dreaming of the knockout stage and writing a new chapter in one of the most remarkable stories in international football in recent years. Standing in their way is not only Nigeria, who desperately need a win after losing their first match to Croatia 2-0, but also the challenge of the heat in the southern Russian city."
"Two thieves from Metro Vancouver have been arrested and charged after they allegedly committed a lengthy series of mail thefts and identity theft-related crimes. After the Coquitlam RCMP and Canada Post inspectors worked together on the mail theft investigation, investigators identified the main suspect, made arrests, and used search warrants to seize a large amount of evidence, according to an November 11 Coquitlam RCMP press release. Hai Ne Hat, a 49-year-old Surrey resident well-known to police, is facing six charges, including mail theft, unauthorized use of a postal key, as well as possession of stolen mail and a stolen credit card."
"First, we looked at which major brands are the most expensive to maintain over the first 10 years of a car's life. We grouped all model years by brand to calculate their average cost by brand. To estimate annual maintenance costs, we determined the amount spent on every other oil change (since oil changes are typically done every six months). German imports, perhaps not surprisingly, top the list by a wide margin. Toyota and its two brands, Lexus and Scion, are among the cheapest, saving owners at least $10,000 over ten years compared to BMW."

"Veteran Congressman Jim Leach (R-IA) was defeated in the 2006 bloodbath. I'm not a defender of ""moderate Republicans,"" but it's worth saying that Leach, in my view, was fairly obviously the best Republican in the House. Nonetheless, one can only rejoice at his defeat. The fact that it happened only shows just how fundamentally rotten the entire Republican Party setup has become. Leach was, in many ways, a man with genuinely decent instincts and some fundamentally correct ideas about how the US should behave in the world. Nonetheless, in practice, he was useless."
"Donald Trump's tweets have long raised questions about whether they violate Twitter's rules forbidding abusive behavior on the service. On Monday, after a Trump tweet threatened that North Korea ""won't be around much longer,"" Twitter was forced to explain why the president wasn't blocked from the service. In a six-tweet statement from Twitter's public policy account, the company said that Twitter takes into account ""newsworthiness"" and ""public interest"" when determining whether a user has violated its rules. These factors have long been used internally at the company when deciding the fate of a problematic user, Twitter said."
"No one can predict with certainty when the stock markets will end their record bull run. But the best way for investors to cope with the future downturn is to remain calm and follow a well-thought-out plan. The Star asked Ashley Feinstein Gerstley, author of the book ""30-Day Financial Detox: Take Control of Your Money, Manage Your Expenses, and Get Rid of Financial Stress Forever"", about why people have such a hard time managing their own finances - and how they can do it better. There are also other common expenses that people tend to overlook or accidentally misreport."
"After largely going according to plan during the first two months of the year, real estate sales in Summit County experienced a slump in March, leading to a notable downturn in first-quarter numbers, according to Slifer Smith & Frampton. The High Country real estate market giant tracks a wide range of statistics related to the local real estate market, and Summit County saw about a 12-percent decline in both the number of real estate transactions and their overall value during the first three months of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017, according to the company's latest market report."

"South Bend (IN) -- On Thursday morning, the Irish took to the practice field for the final time before Saturday's Blue-Gold game. One of the biggest questions the team faced entering spring practice remains unanswered: who will step up at linebacker? Defensive coordinator Clark Lea said that fifth-year linebacker Asmar Bilal is currently the closest to an ""absolute"" in the unit, but he seems to agree with the uncertainty. He believes the position has made big strides over the last month and a half, but is in no hurry to have everything in place, as the first week of the season is still a few months away."
"This month, Drake wrapped up his residency at the O2 Arena in London. But he wasn't ready to fly back across the ocean and head home just yet. Instead, over the weekend, he joined Tiffany Calver, host of a rap show on BBC 1Xtra, and became her co-host for the day. While he was there, he talked about a multitude of things. He reminisced about the early days of his career and even addressed rumors that he's a culture vulture because he appropriates British and Caribbean cultures. But the most interesting thing, well, at least to us Africans, was his admiration for Niniola."

"It's hard to overstate the success and growing power of Amazon. Their market capitalization hovers just below $1 trillion. Their growth rates have been staggering. By most estimates, Amazon now accounts for nearly 50% of all e-commerce revenue in the US, about 5% of all retail sales, and significantly more than their next 10 competitors combined. One study shows that about 55% of all online product searches start on Amazon. This week's report that Amazon is considering opening up to 3,000 of its cashierless Amazon Go stores by 2021 has garnered a lot of attention, despite the fact that they've only opened their fourth location a few days ago."
"NEW YORK — The lawyer who went on a tirade against Spanish-speaking employees at a New York restaurant apologized on Tuesday. ""To those people I offended, I apologize. Seeing myself online, I was opened-eyed — the way I expressed myself is inexcusable and is not the person I am. I see that my words and actions hurt people, and for that I am deeply sorry. While people should be able to express themselves freely, they should do so calmly and respectfully. What the video did not convey is the real me. I am not a racist."
"Some apps aim to change the world, while others are designed to bring beauty to your pocket gadget. Beautiful Clock Widgets falls into the latter category. This small Android app does exactly what it says on the label, offering a collection of clock widgets with the option to add extra data, such as local weather and battery charge information. Some of them are cool, others are funky, and a few are just plain weird. It's worth noting that some of them are only available in the Pro version, which costs $1.26 or the equivalent in your local currency."

"It's not uncommon for us to read and hear complaints about the amount of litter used by the two main parties, a phenomenon that seems to intensify during election campaigns. And yet, rarely do these two parties actively strive for real litter. And by this I mean a conversation about trash in the literal sense! And yet, the problem of trash and waste in general is one that affects us all, touching on issues of public health, social cohesion, and tourism, among other things!"
"The city of Zamboanga - Horror gripped the residents of Pata Island in Sulu, and it's not coming from extremists, but from politicians. The residents have sought help from the government to prevent another attack on their island community, which, according to one of them, was triggered by the residents' refusal to support the incumbent mayor, Anton Burahan. ""We are helpless,"" said 60-year-old Bidin Jubaill, a resident of Saimbangan, one of the villages on Pata Island.

"The life of the mind puzzles poets and neurobiologists who are mapping it and assigning labels to it, and, in my case, trying to find it. The very thought is something worth pondering in the Irish tradition, and therefore, there are many concepts in the Irish language related to the mind, dreams, and imagination. I'm just a student, so many nuances will be lost on me, but language is conversation. I would love to hear how native speakers propose more complex thoughts about the vocabulary of Irish thought."
"According to analysts, the market is entering a consolidation phase after the recent rally. NEW DELHI: The below-normal monsoon forecast by private weather agency Skymet proved to be a big dampener for stock indices on Wednesday, which gave up their positions after hitting all-time highs. As per Skymet, the 2019 monsoon is likely to be ""below normal"" at 93% of the long period average (LPA) of 887 mm over four months, starting from June and ending in September.

Michal Ya'akov, a representative of the Israeli army, said that he saw a person behaving suspiciously at the Hawara checkpoint on Monday, which led soldiers to believe that he was armed with explosives."
"Ottawa, March 20 (Reuters) - In the latest blow to the government of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a lawmaker quit the ruling Liberal Party to sit as an independent on Wednesday after defending a former minister at the center of a political scandal. Trudeau has been on the defensive since February 7 over allegations that senior officials working for him pressured former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to ensure that construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoided a trial on corruption charges. The political crisis threatens the government's chances of re-election in a vote set for October this year."

"The Grant Bar and Grill is a lively spot where local musicians play on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evenings, as well as Sundays during lunch on the outdoor patio. If the Old Fish House could talk, just imagine the captivating stories it would tell of 100 years of living alongside the Indian River Lagoon. It could tell us about the early days when entire families slept on their fishing boats. We would hear tales of the morning light on the river, as the husbands took the same boats and joined the fishing fleet heading out to sea, while the families stayed behind with the wives who worked tirelessly in the fish house, processing the fish."
"Washington, July 31, 2018 / 15:01. - The Washington Metro was entitled to ban the Washington Archdiocese's religious advertisements, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled on Tuesday.

"Maureen Wildes claims it's time to learn about the true impact of the Vietnam War on the children of veterans. Like many other children of veterans, I am also a statistic.

Hello, I am the wife of a Vietnam veteran, I have three children. My first daughter from my first marriage when I was 18, and the next two girls from my second marriage in 1970."

"Less than two years ago, I was at a South Atlantic League (Low A ball) game between the Hagerstown Suns and the visiting Greensboro Grasshoppers. Behind me were two Greensboro pitchers - Trevor Richards and Ben Meyer. They were keeping track of the game's stats. As I mentioned in this post, neither of the pitchers seemed destined for the big leagues. Richards wasn't drafted in 2015 after graduating from a small college, so he had to start his career with the Gateway Grizzlies of the Frontier League, which is an independent league. The Miami Marlins signed him in 2016, and he was doing well with Greensboro."

What does the UN hope to find from this investigation? What actions is the UN prepared to take?"

"Without a doubt, the addiction drama ""Beautiful Boy"" - not the horror film ""Halloween"" - is the most disturbing movie opening in theaters this weekend. Starring Steve Carell (""Foxcatcher"") and Timothée Chalamet (""Call Me By Your Name""), the film is a haunting and harrowing look at a young man's descent into methamphetamine addiction (and heroin, pills, marijuana, etc.) and the efforts of a devoted father trying to save him. It's a true and terrifying story, so powerful that even an uninspired director and cliched script can't diminish its impact."

Everyone has a busy life, but if you have recently relocated a loved one to a nursing home or memory care cottage, it's even more important to stay connected with them. Nutrition is important in everyone's life, but especially in the elderly."

High above Midtown Manhattan, the leader of the Republican presidential pack and the leading woman in evening news met to settle the score. Donald Trump and Megyn Kelly, who for much of the election cycle had publicly feuded, privately seethed at or ignored each other, met at Trump Tower on Monday, apparently putting an end to the silence between them. ""Yes, the doormen seemed a little bewildered when I walked in,"" Kelly said on her Fox News program on Wednesday evening."
"Navy builders from Naval Mobile Construction Battalion (NMCB) 7 and members of Alpha Company, 427th Army Brigade Support Battalion, stand in formation during a transfer of authority ceremony at Camp Moreell, Southwest Asia, May 23. The Navy builders operated Camp Moreell, named after Admiral Ben Moreell, the ""Father of the Seabees,"" for nearly 10 years as a main base and assembly point for many sailors who were deployed to serve in Southwest Asia before transferring their duties to the Army. The primary hub for Seabee deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan and back was closed during a ceremony held at Ali Al Salem Air Base, Kuwait, May 23."
"The University of Sri Jayewardenepura marked 60 years of excellence in higher education on 18 February 2019, reaching a significant milestone in its historic journey. The diamond jubilee will be celebrated with the participation of President Maithripala Sirisena, Chancellor, the Most Venerable Dr. Ittapane Dhammalankara, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Senior Professor Sampath Amaratunga and other dignitaries at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) on 2 April 2019. The University of Sri Jayewardenepura's rich and vibrant history - initially as Vidyodaya Pirivena - dates back to 1873."
"Magic is the best way to describe the Rugby Academy of Lytton High School Hurricanes' championship win in Levin. In only the academy's second year of existence, the under-15 girls' team, led by coach Trish Hina, defeated Wanganui 66-0, Feilding 42-0, and Kapiti 49-0 on the first day. On the second day, they beat a combined Wairarapa-Bush team 61-0 and Mana College 73-5, before thrashing Feilding 63-10 in the final. The Lytton team is a cohesive unit, and over six games, they conceded only three tries. ""The girls have worked extremely hard to achieve what they have now,"" said Hina, a former New Zealand Black Ferns rugby player."
"Vodafone has announced changes to its data roaming tariffs. These changes will benefit those who use less than 5MB of data a day while abroad. The daily network rate in Europe from June 15 will be £1 per megabyte for the first 5MB, and then £5 for every subsequent 5MB. Outside Europe, the rate will be £3 per megabyte for the first 5MB, and then £15 for every 5MB. These changes will benefit those with minimal data requirements, but those who need constant internet access will pay more for the privilege."
"PREBLE COUNTY — Following two serious accidents involving young people in Preble County over the past week, Preble County Sheriff Mike Simpson discussed summer driving practices, when younger, less experienced drivers become more active during the summer months. According to Simpson, during the summer, the roads often become more congested, and young drivers are more frequently on the roads, as they are no longer in school. ""When kids are not in school or are coming home from college, there are a lot more young drivers on the road, driving back and forth to events or to work, since they are no longer spending 6-7 hours a day in school,"" Simpson said."
"Relatives of the dead bravely listened as the circumstances of the death were detailed. Irritating details about how the Clutha helicopter crash victims died were limited at the fatal accident inquiry today. This happened in a joint minute of agreement - a legal mechanism that means the prosecution and the other 14 legal parties to the inquiry will not contest the details. Gary Arthur, 48, a sales consultant, was found in the pub, trapped under debris. He had no pulse when he was found by paramedics. A post-mortem examination showed that he died from head injuries."
"The state Board of Corrections voted unanimously at a special meeting this morning to make interim Director Kevin Murphy the permanent head of the Department of Corrections. His existing salary of $123,380 will remain unchanged. Murphy was put in charge after Governor Asa Hutchinson fired Sheila Sharp over questions about the adequacy of the agency's parole and probation staffing. Murphy has a complicated history in the position. At one point, he had a contract paid for by a nonprofit that works on behalf of agency employees, and was also drawing a Corrections Department pension."
"Californians, more than anyone else, should understand what it means to displace people from their land. In the 1850s-1860s, the state funded annual expeditions that devastated entire areas of Native American presence. But this is not just a historical phenomenon: On the West Bank, Israeli settlers and the Israeli government have been trying for decades to destroy the small Palestinian village of Susya. The village has existed near Hebron since at least the 19th century. In the 1980s, it was declared an archaeological site to allow settlers to move in and replace the former residents."
"Speaker Nabih Berri and the Syrian ambassador to Lebanon on Friday discussed the ""Israeli-Western schemes"" in the Syrian civil war, Berri's office reported. The Lebanese army on Friday set up a cordon in preparation for the destruction of an old arms depot discovered in the Sidon area of Siniq. Lebanese workers held 28 strikes and 121 protests in 2018, including strikes at the state-run electricity company Electricite Du Liban and at the Lebanese University, a rights monitor reported on Friday. An Iranian national was arrested in Beirut on charges of human trafficking and forging official documents, the Asharq al-Awsat newspaper reported on Friday."
"Every year, the police and state authorities ensure that Bangaloreans are warned ahead of Diwali to be safe. However, as in previous years, over 60 firecracker-related injuries have already been reported in the city this year. Shockingly, this year children aged between 4 and 14 years have suffered eye injuries due to ignoring fire safety measures. The city was filled with a festive spirit from Monday, but the city's hospitals have collectively admitted 60 firecracker victims. Additionally, starting from yesterday, local clinics in several residential areas have been attending to patients every hour."
"Bhubaneswar: Sashi Bhusan Behera, Minister of Finance and Excise, hopes that IOCL will participate in the Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) created for the development of PCPIR in Paradip, as well as in the Plastic Park in Paradip through equity participation. Besides, IOCL needs to evolve an attractive pricing mechanism for feedstock to encourage setting up of production units in Paradip. The State Government has also approached the Ministry of Chemicals and Petrochemicals, Government of India, to provide budgetary support of at least Rs 3000 crore for undertaking necessary infrastructure development works in the region, said Sri Behera."
"A popular Belgian waffle franchise has opened in Dubai with the help of the government's small and medium enterprise support agency. The Yummy Waffles cafe opened in Dubai Festival City on Sunday as part of a franchising agreement with Dubai SME, an agency of the Department of Economic Development tasked with developing the small and medium enterprise sector. The cafe is part of the So Good Company franchise, best known for its waffle batter. It already has stores across Europe, North America, South Africa, Turkey, Hong Kong, and mainland China. Chairman Abdul Salam Al Hammadi said the Dubai cafe will also serve some Arabic flavors."
"Avid ""redesigned and reimagined"" Media Composer, relaunching it to attract future generations of editors. At the Avid Connect event held in Las Vegas just before NAB 2019, Avid unveiled Media Composer 2019, which was designed to cater to both current and future users. Avid describes Media Composer 2019 as a product that provides a ""new user experience"", with a customizable role-based user interface. Avid's bins have been overhauled, and the software is now equipped with task-based workspaces that display only the elements the user may need to complete a specific task."
"A cancer expert has found a way to kill tumors in just two hours - using light. The method involves a one-time introduction of a chemical substance, followed by a burst of ultraviolet radiation. It was found that cancer cells in laboratory mice self-destruct, with up to 95 percent of cells dying within two hours. Professor Matthew Gdovin revealed that the cells he introduced with the chemical compound nitrobenzaldehyde became too acidic to survive. He said after patenting his ""photodynamic"" therapy: ""There are many different types of cancer. One thing they have in common is their susceptibility to this induced cell suicide."""
"Drones are released today in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, but speaking generally, most of them still belong to one of two categories. There are those that belong to the multi-rotor type (quadcopters, hexacopters, octacopters, etc.), and those that belong to the winged type. Each category has its own advantages and disadvantages. Multi-rotor aircraft are usually more stable and easier to control, but also much slower than winged drones, which focus on accelerating forward. In contrast, winged drones can fly faster and farther than their hovering counterparts, but are more difficult to pilot, as they cannot perform vertical takeoffs and landings."
"BASEL, Switzerland – Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche Holding AG said on Monday it had received reports of 13 cases in which the H1N1 flu had become resistant to Tamiflu, which it considered a very low percentage. A good sign was that people with the resistant strain had not passed the disease on to other people, said David Reddy, the head of Roche's Tamiflu pandemic task force. And the resistant variant was similar to the widely circulating version of the virus in that it usually caused only mild symptoms. The 13 cases were scattered around the world in Europe, the United States, and Asia, Reddy said."
"Russian President Vladimir Putin called the downing of a Russian fighter jet by Turkish military today (November 24) ""a stab in the back, carried out by the accomplices of terrorists"", stating that the incident will have serious consequences. Speaking at the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi on Tuesday before a meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah, Putin said the downed plane was attacked over Syria when it was just 1 kilometer away from the Turkish border and crashed 4 kilometers inside Syria. This contradicts Turkey's claim that the plane was warned multiple times that it had entered Turkish airspace before it was shot down."
"Arsene Wenger believes the return to training of English forward Theo Walcott and the imminent recovery of German player Lukas Podolski means that Arsenal are not under extra pressure to buy another striker in January. The Gunners resume domestic matches on Saturday, seeking to respond to a 1-0 defeat by Manchester United with a win over third-placed Southampton to stay top of the Barclays Premier League. Walcott is set to face his former club after about two months out with an abdominal problem that required surgery. Podolski, meanwhile, is on course to be available again by the end of December after being out of action since August 27 with a hamstring injury."
"The New York Knicks are approaching the quarter mark of the calendar with a mediocre 9-9 record, looking to end a 43-year championship drought. Coach Jeff Hornacek and the Knicks will have the upper hand against opponents in December. Of the 15 games they will play this month, only five will be against teams with a positive record. They will host the 5-13 Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday. Joakim Noah, Derrick Rose, and Carmelo Anthony are perhaps the most prominent names on the roster, but they are not performing up to expectations. Anthony's average of 22.2 points per game, leading the team, is slightly higher than last season."
"The Hashemite Library remained a beacon of knowledge and a destination for readers and intellectuals until 2000, when the number of readers began to decline due to the difficult economic situation in the Gaza Strip. In the 1950s, the Hashemite Library received an order to sell newspapers and books from prominent Egyptian publishing houses and distributors. It was also a space for writers and intellectuals to meet. However, the invasion of the Internet and the poverty of Gaza Strip residents hindered these activities. ""Due to the rise of the Internet and economic stagnation, we no longer received books for distribution or sale."
"Google has long had a tense relationship with China, and the search giant largely pulled out of the Chinese market after it said state-backed hackers had targeted the company's systems and employees. An upcoming book by chairman Eric Schmidt, ""The New Digital Age"", is unlikely to improve the situation, judging by a description of the work in the Wall Street Journal, which has seen galley copies of the not-yet-released book. ""...in this global internet, China is, as the book repeatedly says, the most dangerous and threatening superpower"", writes Tom Gara."
"Ray Trew has stepped down as chairman of Notts County and announced that the League Two club is up for sale. Trew became owner and chairman in 2010, but stated that he made the decision after his family had been subjected to ""vile and mindless abuse"" in recent days. Notts, who appointed Jamie Fullarton as manager in January, are 16th in League Two, having been relegated last season. According to BBC Radio Nottingham, local businessman Alan Hardy is in talks to buy the club. ""With very mixed emotions, I am announcing the end of my tenure,"" Trew wrote in an open letter to fans."
"Warning: the video above contains graphic images. SODUS, N.Y. (WHEC) -- A new management team promised changes would be made, but complaints about care and conditions inside the Sodus Rehabilitation and Nursing Center continue to come in. News10NBC has been investigating the facility and its record for over a year, and although management was replaced last summer, families continue to face serious safety concerns inside. Joy Ann Mitchell-Kinley was under the care of Bill Tanner's father, as her father and Bill Tanner were best friends, and when her father passed away, Bill took Joy Ann under his wing."
"Do you want to put an end to the war against informants? Review the Espionage Act. Over the past 100 years, this law has evolved into a tool for state secrecy. The evolution of the Espionage Act has done a lot to shape the freedom of political discussions in modern America. What began as a vague law giving President Woodrow Wilson the power to imprison critics and censor the media during World War I has turned into a powerful law regulating political discussions by monitoring secrets, rather than speech. Censorship did not end with the end of the war. It evolved. Despite its name, the Espionage Act has always been a broad law."
"Google is trying to save presentation audiences from having to listen to long, rambling questions with a new feature it added to its Slides software on Wednesday. Slides Q&A will allow audiences to submit text questions over the internet while listening to a presentation using Google's software. As the speaker talks, she can see the questions and answer them without waiting for someone to speak up at the microphone. The view in Google Slides Q&A allows speakers to see what people in their audience want to know. In addition to submitting questions, audience members can also vote for the ones they want to see answered."
"Manfred Weber (41) is the newly elected chairman of the European People's Party (EPP), the largest political group represented in the European Parliament after the 2014 elections. He hails from the conservative Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) in Germany. Weber spoke with Dario Sarmadi from EURACTIV Germany. David Cameron wants the UK to leave the EU if Jean-Claude Juncker becomes President of the European Commission. What can you say to the British Prime Minister? The UK belongs in the EU - and is stronger within the community itself."
"As Conservative Party leader William Hague made his way through a crowd of loyal supporters at a dinner rally on Tuesday, and the host introduced the ""next Prime Minister of Britain"", even many of his supporters couldn't help but stifle an involuntary laugh. The Conservative-leaning London newspaper The Times had just for the first time in its history endorsed the Labour Party, backing Prime Minister Tony Blair for a second term. The country's largest bookmaker, Ladbrokes, had already stopped taking bets on Thursday's election and begun paying out winnings on bets for a Labour victory."
"April 24, 2014, 10:30 am.
In several smart news companies, a growth of digital advertising and a smart strategy is observed. But most newspaper companies find that the key figures are still moving in the wrong direction. Ken Doctor @kdoctor April 24, 2014, 10:30 am.
As we approach the mid-2010s, where are newspapers in the battle for America's largest advertising sector - digital? And how well are all those paywalls working? Two reports appeared in the public domain within a week of each other recently, and together they help us answer both questions."
"From the M1917 to the M1A2, American tanks have dominated the battlefield. The US Army and Marine Corps are on the cusp of a centennial anniversary - 100 years of tanks in American service. This animated GIF, compiled by people from partcatalog.com, shows the evolution of the American tank - from the rickety light tank M1917 to the M1A2 Abrams - and demonstrates how the US transformed from a novice in the world of tanks to a world leader. The M1917 light tank, for example, was simply a copy of the Renault FT-17. Such an approach to copying engineering would be unthinkable now."
"The first among all such groups to get a name is the Bajrang Dal, whose activist burned alive Australian missionary Graham Staines along with his two young sons in Orissa in 1999. This heart-wrenching incident is cited as an early example of saffron terror in India. The ugly face of Hindutva terrorism is again in the spotlight with the arrest of three persons in Maharashtra for allegedly hatching a plot to carry out ""terrorist activities"" at various places in the state. According to the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), 22 articles were seized from the house of the accused in Pune."
"Meet ... Ron Brown from AAG Archaeology with the netty door. Below - a picture of Westoe Netty. The toilet door found in a historic South Tyneside building now occupies a place of pride in one of the North East's most popular tourist attractions. During a survey of a Regency townhouse on Beach Road in South Shields, staff from North East-based company AAG Archaeology discovered what may be the only netty door to have made it into a museum collection. It was the eagle-eyed archaeologist Ron Brown who spotted that it is believed to be the best preserved example of a classic North East netty door, protruding from the rubble of a demolished toilet."
"The best part of M. Night Shyamalan's 2017 horror film ""Split"" - and one of the few things he got right - occurred right at the end. A brief, stunning revelation featuring Bruce Willis reprising his role as David Dunn from ""Unbreakable"", created a shared universe that Shyamalan was all too eager to capitalize on. Unfortunately, there's a big gap between teasing fans with a momentary appearance, and building a story around it. ""Glass"", the third film in what's become a trilogy, feels like a mishmash of underformed ideas, mixed into an uneven stew."

"Sign RootsAction's petition to mayors and police chiefs around the country affirming your support for the right to unrestricted peaceful protests. Occupy Wall Street demonstrators scored a major victory on Friday when Mayor Bloomberg and Brookfield Properties, the owners of New York's Zuccotti Park, backed down from their demand that activists temporarily leave the park for cleaning and subsequently abide by new rules banning sleeping bags, most equipment, and even lying down. Demonstrators in many other cities have not been so fortunate."
"Products of Progressive Networks - RealAudio and RealVideo for streaming - got an impulse for development today, when it became known that Microsoft is planning to acquire a minority stake in the company and get a license for its key products, RealAudio and RealVideo 4.0. As part of the agreement, Microsoft will integrate Progressive technologies into Internet Explorer clients and the NetShow streaming server, and the companies will cooperate to ensure the compatibility of their server and client products. In turn, Progressive will support Microsoft's Active Streaming Format (ASF) format, as well as its own file formats, and use Microsoft's DirectShow and DirectDraw APIs, as well as other technologies in future versions of its clients for Windows."
"ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) - Mike Minor was able to finish what he started, something the left-hander couldn't do for the Texas Rangers in his return to the rotation last season. The Angels are 2-14 in their last 16 road games, dating back to September, a period in which they are 12-2 at home. ... The Rangers have homered in all 10 home games, which is the longest season-opening home homer streak in Texas history. ... It was the second shutout of the season for Texas, both at home after they had only one shutout at home all of last season."
"January 5, 2017, 11 am. Box V2 scans for weak passwords and prevents accidental sending of personal data to fake websites. LAS VEGAS - Bitdefender has updated its network security tool, now known as the New Bitdefender Box or Box Version 2, which is designed to protect home networks and Internet of Things devices from external attacks.

By moving protection to the network level, Box products protect all devices on the network, including refrigerators, game consoles, and security cameras."
"Technology company leaders are discussing the impact of automation technologies on their organizations. For many organizations and their employees, technological automation is both an opportunity and a threat. On the one hand, the use of automation, robotic process automation, and other tools creates efficiency by automating manual and repetitive tasks. On the other hand, it has the potential to make work redundant. Technology company leaders recently gathered at roundtable events in Sydney and Melbourne to discuss the impact of automation technologies on their organizations. One of the key issues raised during the discussion was the challenge of ensuring compliance with policy and governance procedures when replacing human-performed tasks with ""bots"" across the company."
"Baceapp Corporation and LightSpin Technologies Inc. will be moving into Binghamton University's engineering and science building. The two companies plan to create 39 jobs and invest $540,000 over the next five years while being located in tax-free zones at Binghamton University, as announced on Monday by Governor Andrew Cuomo's office. Baceapp Corporation and LightSpin Technologies Inc., which will be moving into the Binghamton University engineering and science building, were two of 17 companies introduced on Monday as new participants in the Start-Up NY program, which offers 10 years of tax freedom in locations near or on college campuses."
"WASHINGTON, March 1 - After a year in which a record number of natural disasters costing over $1 billion were recorded, representatives of leading insurance companies stated today that the costs to taxpayers and businesses due to extreme weather conditions will continue to rise due to climate change. Insurers joined Senators Bernie Sanders (Independent - Vermont) and Sheldon Whitehouse (Democrat - Rhode Island) at a press conference to discuss the growing financial impact of global warming. Both Vermont and Rhode Island were hit by Tropical Storm Irene in August last year, one of 14 record-breaking natural disasters in the US last year, each causing damage of over $1 billion."
"It was another quarter of rapid growth for the optical equipment manufacturer, but shares fell as investors were uninspired by the revenue forecast. Infinera (NASDAQ:INFN) released its Q1 results on April 27 after the market closed. While the results slightly exceeded the company's own guidance, traders sold shares during Thursday's trading as the company forecast that growth would slow in the next quarter. By 15:40, shares had fallen almost 24% from the previous close. Let's take a closer look at the results to see how the company performed in three areas that I think investors should focus on."
"Edgar Wright has never made a bad film, he hasn't even made a film that's just good, and so it's entirely logical that up until now in his career Wright has avoided direct sequels. However, this may change with the film ""Baby Driver"". When ""Shaun of the Dead"" was a huge success, rather than using it to create a zombie sequel, Wright, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost instead made a thematically linked trilogy of films - the ""Cornetto Trilogy"" - with the also excellent ""Hot Fuzz"" and ""The World's End""."
"TTP, apparently, cannot fund its operations due to a lack of money. ISLAMABAD: The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) is facing a severe financial crisis since its slain founder Baitullah Mehsud united several fragmented groups from all corners of the tribal territory to form the deadliest terrorist network of homegrown militants in 2007. ""The Taliban have seriously depleted their financial resources... they have almost no money left,"" said at least three associates of the group against the backdrop of a surprising lull in their activities - bombings and terrorist attacks across Pakistan and in some parts of Afghanistan - over the past few months."
"In the third quarter of 2018, luxury home prices rose 3.2% year-over-year to an average of $1.7 million, according to the latest data from Redfin. Redfin defines luxury homes as those that were sold among the top 5% most expensive in the quarter. According to the company, sales of homes priced at $2 million or more increased for the ninth consecutive quarter. However, this is the slowest growth rate since the beginning of 2016. Additionally, the number of homes listed for sale at $2 million or more decreased by 6% year-over-year."

"The General Office of Accounting reported last month that the Small Business Administration should improve planning for the new database system. The SBA had planned to introduce the Electronic Loan Processing and Information System (ELIPS), which is used to track government loans for small businesses online last week, but the GAO stated that the agency had not shown that the project was a good investment. The SBA stated that it did not have time to complete the analysis required by the Clinger-Cohen Act, as Congress had required the system to be introduced by June 30. The US Army Materiel Command has published guidelines to improve teamwork between agencies and contractors."
"Surinamese intelligence agencies. Photo by Sanoesie101, Wikipedia. Location of Surinam. Source: CIA World Factbook. In 1980, a group of non-commissioned officers (NCOs) overthrew the elected government, despite intense resistance from the poorly armed police, who were only suppressed when the naval fleet bombarded them into submission. This led to the establishment of a de-facto military dictatorship (although there was a nominal civilian president) in the country for the next seven years, led by Sergeant-Major (self-promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel) Dési Delano Bouterse."
"The Lifetime TV channel has stated that it will show a film about the relationship between Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown. And the network has done everything to hire a veteran actress who starred alongside the singer in the film ""Waiting to Exhale"" to direct the biographical film. Angela Bassett, 55, is set to make her directorial debut in the television film, which will focus on the late pop star who passed away in 2012. Lifetime announced that the film will follow Houston and Brown from their first meeting and tumultuous marriage. It also promises to tell the story of the singer's rise to fame with ""I Will Always Love You""."
"For the first time I heard these verses in a small church located in a store in Kiev, Ukraine. I remember it because it was on the same Sunday when the tragic death of Princess Diana was reported. I had recently quit my job on Wall Street and was living in Kiev with my mother after my father had passed away, and I was there because I was having bad luck finding my way forward. I remember the wooden panels on the walls of the room where I sat in the back, a bit embarrassed by the enthusiasm of my fellow evangelists. But when I heard these verses, my wandering mind came back."
"She grew up in a predominantly white, working-class housing estate. ""We were the only black people, and I was regularly called racist names,"" she recalls. ""Lying in bed, I would pray and ask to be taught to teach children to be kind to me and others."" ""That led me to have a 'rainbow of friends' - Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Rastafarians and Christians. I always wanted to connect with the heart and soul of people, regardless of faith or culture."
"Getty Images photographer John Moore will receive the Impact Award from the Lucie Awards program on Sunday at Carnegie Hall in New York. These awards honor outstanding achievements in photography. Moore will join eight other honorees who will be recognized for their work at the awards ceremony. This is not the first award for the photojournalist, who grew up in Irving and graduated from the University of Texas at Austin. He has already received the 2005 Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Photography, two awards from the Foreign Correspondents' Club, and the title of ""Photographer of the Year"" from Pictures of the Year International, as well as other awards."
"Guess what? The NBA is indeed show business. Only super producer David Stern doesn't pull all the strings from behind the scenes (otherwise, New York would have somehow won the draft lottery). On the contrary, the league moves like an overly expensive and uncontrollable Hollywood production - driven by the ego of big-money players, full of stunning plot twists, subject to endless rewrites. And to think: we haven't even mentioned the ""Los Angeles Lakers"" yet. Unfortunately, the biggest news of the season has nothing to do with basketball."
"Doug Newcomb 2015 Lincoln MKC If you want a stylish, affordable luxury crossover that's an alternative to the usual import suspects, the 2015 Lincoln MKC is a compelling choice. Relatively affordable price. Wide range of driver assist options. Quiet interior. Outdated infotainment interface. Less lively engine compared to competitors. If you want a stylish, affordable luxury crossover that's an alternative to the usual import suspects, the 2015 Lincoln MKC is a compelling choice. While Ford is setting sales records and making money hand over fist, its luxury Lincoln division is largely lagging behind the competition."
"NASA is going to lower a small robot into a volcano in Hawaii to map its internal data and geographical features, such as cracks and volcanic vents. A similar robot is already exploring the volcano. ""We don't know exactly how volcanoes erupt. We have models, but they're all very, very simplified. This project is aimed at making those models more realistic,"" said Carolyn Parcheta, a postdoctoral researcher based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, according to NASA. The NASA-developed robot can climb in areas inaccessible to humans."
"Hearst Magazines will be busy in 2018, completing its acquisition of Rodale, buying some magazines in the Netherlands, and increasing the frequency of two of its newest titles. The Pioneer Woman Magazine, a joint venture with blogger and Food Network star Ree Drummond, published two sold-out issues in 2017 and will double its frequency to four issues in 2018, as Hearst Magazines President David Carey told employees in his annual year-end letter. This is a good turn for Airbnb, which tried to launch its own magazine called Pineapple in 2014, which only lasted one issue."
"A meeting on the future of Kirkcaldy town centre should include discussions on disability access, campaigners insist.

A Dundee nursery has been unable to increase its intake of children. Dundee inventor John Cruickshank has died at the age of 84. It all started as an act of defiance which quickly spread across the world. A Montrose pensioner has been left shocked and distressed after Angus Council ordered her to remove all her bird feeders from her front garden."
"The daughter of the editor of a Kannada tabloid, arrested for allegedly hiring a hitman to kill a fellow journalist, today claimed her father was ""not guilty"" and would ""safely"" come out of the case. Ravi Belagere, who publishes the Hi Bangalore tabloid, was arrested yesterday from his home for allegedly hiring a ""supari"" killer from Vijayapura in north Karnataka to kill Sunil Heggaravalli. ""No one has filed a complaint with the police in this case based on a complaint filed by someone. This is a case registered by the police on their own based on the statement of Shailesh (the hitman)""."
"Manatees are large, grey, aquatic mammals. They have thick bodies - I think 'full-figured' is how clothing companies would try to convince manatees to buy larger jeans - that taper to a flat, paddle-like tail. Average adult manatees reach lengths of about 3 meters and weigh between 360 and 540 kilograms. Manatees are one of God's ugliest ocean creatures, and there are a lot of weird sea creatures out there. These are facts - well, the observation about ugliness is an opinion, but it's obvious enough to be considered fact - that I learned from the Save the Manatee Club's website."

"A French woman who received the world's first partial face transplant showed off her new features to the public on Monday, speaking in a raspy voice, saying she now looks ""like everyone else"" and hopes to return to a normal life. Isabelle Dinoire's speech was difficult to understand, but she explained how she was disfigured by a dog bite last year, and she thanked the donor's family, who gave her new lips, chin, and nose. A thin, circular scar was still visible where the facial tissue was grafted on during the 15-hour operation in Amiens on November 27."
"Did Donald Trump release Donald Trump's tax return? For a moment, it seemed like Rachel Maddow had a real scoop. And then, suddenly, everything changed…. Thanks to MSNBC, the assumption that Trump 'paid no taxes for 18 years' was now proven to be false. Moreover, Trump apparently paid a higher tax rate in 2005 than most politicians, and, in addition, had a fairly large income. It is unknown whether the report was selectively edited."
"MOUNT PLEASANT, Sanpete County — School officials are asking students who aren't up to date on their vaccinations to stay home for a few weeks as Sanpete County deals with a mumps outbreak. There are two confirmed cases of mumps in Sanpete County, according to a statement from North Sanpete School District Superintendent Dr. Sam Ray. One of them is a school district student, he said. Another potential case of mumps is currently under consideration as health officials await test results, Ray said. Ray didn't say which school the student with mumps attends, but said North Sanpete Middle School is ""ground zero"" for the outbreak."
"In hard times, creative bakers turned to desperation pies: salt and vinegar pie and green tomato pie are not usually on America's list of favorite sweets. But in Depression-era America, these and other desperation pies that have survived to this day demonstrated the resourcefulness of home cooks. Some desperation pies, like green tomato pie, still enjoy niche success today. Imagine yourself as a resourceful farmer during the Great Depression. You want to make a dessert for your family, but traditional pie ingredients, such as cherries or pecans, are too expensive or unavailable."
"There is a Speed Graphic camera, once standard equipment in newsrooms across the country. You may have seen them in movies from the 1930s and 40s, featuring groups of photographers with ""Press"" badges in the hatbands of their fedoras. Heavy, bulky, and requiring flashbulbs the size of light bulbs to shoot at night, the Speed Graphic was the first camera I used professionally, for the school yearbook and newspaper I worked on part-time while in high school and college. The one that sits in my office used sheet film - you'd take a shot, pull out the sheet holder, and insert another."
"Anyone who has ever been frustrated by the task of shooting video in low light should be prepared to be thrilled by Canon's strange and wonderful new camera. It's a video camera that shoots full HD video in almost complete darkness. The ""multipurpose"" camera, dubbed the MH20F-SH, features a full-frame sensor with 2.26 megapixels. The reason for the modest resolution is that each pixel is very large — 19 microns, to be exact. That's 7.5 times larger than, say, the pixels found on a flagship DSLR like the Canon 1Dx."
"Is our efficient tax office killing this country? I've never seen a story where the Reserve Bank has called on the government to provide tax cuts, but that's what's happening now, which partly explains why our economy is going backwards. In fact, the upshot of this historically unusual story is that the tax commissioner, Chris Jordan, and his team are doing such a great job uncovering excessive claims for deductions, particularly by businesses. Thanks to productivity gains from computer technology, tax revenues to government are rising."
"The facility manager wears many hats. It's not uncommon for a facility manager to lead a meeting, provide plumbing advice, present a renovation project, and ensure the floors are properly cleaned - all in one day. Facility managers consider the safety and health of all building users as they consider how the facility operates. To be a successful facility manager, a strong foundation in management, technical skills, construction basics, and technology are necessary. The facility manager provides oversight of the physical infrastructure of a building or structural campus."
"A communications professor at Texas A&M University wanted to learn about the effects of changes in the newspaper industry on our nation's politics, so she conducted some research that was published in the Journal of Communication. If you've noticed that there seems to have been a sharp increase in political polarization over the past few years, you're not imagining things. And, as Johanna Dunaway and some colleagues at the Universities of Colorado and Louisiana found out, this polarization occurred during a period of steady decline in the number of local newspapers and journalists across the country."
"WASHINGTON -- An Iowa egg producer at the center of a nationwide salmonella outbreak apologized to a congressional committee on Wednesday and acknowledged that his family business ""got big before it stopped acting small."" ""What I mean by that is we got big before we started putting in place sophisticated procedures to make sure we were meeting all of the government requirements,"" egg producer Austin J. DeCoster said in his testimony before the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee. He is the founder of an egg empire that over three decades has been linked to multiple deadly salmonella outbreaks in several states."
"A conservative candidate standing in local elections was deselected by the party after failing to declare a pending drink-driving case for which he was later convicted. Ben Wong, 48, of the South Dragon House restaurant on Silver Street, had put himself forward to stand in the Victoria ward election on May 2 under the Conservative banner but was ditched after his conviction. The nomination period for the elections closed on April 3 but he appeared before Taunton magistrates on March 21 - something Somerset Conservatives were unaware of."
"Batfleck is officially no more! Ben Affleck has officially stepped down from the role of Bruce Wayne in the Batman film. And he's passing the torch to a new actor, who has yet to be confirmed. Warner Bros. announced the official release date for Batman earlier today, with the DC standalone adventure set to hit theaters on June 25, 2021. Soon after the news was announced, Ben Affleck took to social media to wish director Matt Reeves good luck in taking the caped crusader into the future. The tweet was later confirmed as Ben Affleck's farewell to the character."
"When dining out at a restaurant, it's customary to leave a tip, but one particular surcharge on an order of a milkshake and fries at a New Jersey diner is infuriating parents. ""My daughter would come to me and tell me that every time she and her friends went to the diner, they were being charged a tip,"" said Melissa Desh. ""And when I asked her why, she said, 'Because they're kids'."" Desh said her daughter, Isabella, and other Schuyler-Colfax Middle School students often go to the Wayne Hills Diner, located just across the Hamburg Turnpike from the school."
"DALLAS - Like many Americans, Martin Jacobson was thrilled that Navy SEALs had captured and killed Osama bin Laden. But the Dallas man felt a deeper connection to the people who tracked down the mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. A few decades ago, he was one of them. During World War II, Jacobson was part of an elite group that was a precursor to the SEALs. The secretive special forces are accustomed to being out of the spotlight, but they're back in it again after the bin Laden killing. ""I'm just proud of the SEALs,"" said Jacobson, 89."
"Northern Ireland was today branded the race hate capital of Europe in a report on racist violence in the province. Doreen Lawrence, the human rights activist and mother of murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence, was in Belfast for the launch of the Northern Ireland Council for Ethnic Minorities (NICEM) report. The report identified institutional racism in the criminal justice system and questioned how to tackle it. Racist violence has been on the rise in Northern Ireland in recent years, and not just against black and Asian people, but almost against anyone who is perceived as being different."
"About 300 villagers from Kandal province, embroiled in land disputes with private companies, delivered petitions to embassies in Phnom Penh yesterday, and then staged a protest in front of the provincial council building, calling on Prime Minister Hun Sen to help them. The villagers told the newspaper that they want to put an end to the land disputes caused by companies that ""took their land"", adding that they ""would rather die"" than go home without a result. They stated that the authorities had ignored their requests for help, while the companies used the judicial system to arrest villagers who complained about the seizures."
"The incline bench press is a strength training exercise for the development of the chest and the anterior deltoids. The exercise is performed by lying on a bench set at an incline, then grasping a dumbbell or barbell above, and extending and flexing the elbows to lift the weight above the chest. Incline chest press machines, which mimic the movement in a fixed plane, are another way to perform this exercise. The incline press is one of several exercises that help create symmetry and strength in the muscles of the upper body."
"JURGEN KLOPP revealed his delight at ending Pep Guardiola's 22-match unbeaten run with Manchester City, exclaiming live on air: ""What was that?!"" And the Liverpool boss also hit out at critics targeting his vulnerable defence, adding: ""Blow my boots!"" Klopp was over the moon after masterminding a thrilling 4-3 victory over the league leaders at Anfield this morning. The second half was a real onslaught, with Liverpool racing into a 4-1 lead before City scored two late goals to set up a nervy finish."
"No one asked me, but... if you pay dues to a neo-Nazi organization, subscribe to racist publications, buy tickets to a Holocaust denial conference and have a Holocaust denial DVD in your video collection, you're probably a neo-Nazi. That doesn't mean you're a neo-Nazi forever. You can change your mind and thoughts, and reform. If you want people to believe you're no longer a neo-Nazi, you have a lot to prove. It takes a lot of work to shed the brown shirt."
"The first sign of redemption for Brent Moloney after his post-game drinking session came mid-season when he was quietly reinstated into the club's leadership group. The second, far more public and significant than the first, came last night when he won the Melbourne best and fairest award. Moloney, 27, took home the Keith 'Bluey' Truscott Trophy, edging out key defenders Jared Rivers and James Frawley at the Crown Palladium ceremony. Two of Moloney's midfield partners, Nathan Jones and Jack Trengove, finished fourth and fifth respectively."
"The Weeknd will team up with Daft Punk for a performance at the Grammy Awards. LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Weeknd will team up with Daft Punk for a performance at the Grammy Awards. The collaboration between the singer and the electronic music duo is one of several announced on Tuesday. Anderson .Paak will take the stage with A Tribe Called Quest and Dave Grohl. Maren Morris is set to perform with Alicia Keys. The Grammys had previously announced that Adele, John Legend, Bruno Mars, Metallica, Carrie Underwood, and Keith Urban will also perform."
"DARTMOUTH - On June 14, Flag Day, students at the James M. Quinn Elementary School in Dartmouth gathered outside to celebrate Flag Day. In itself, it's not unusual, but this year it took on a more personal meaning. The reason for this is that Dr. Carol Karadotis' cousin, Ted Cote of New Bedford, is serving in Iraq. Earlier this year, around Veterans Day, Dr. Karadotis asked her students to send cards to Staff Sgt. Cote to boost his morale. The students responded and made cards, which were then sent to Iraq."
"Will UBS's wealth management unit be headed by Bob McCann or Sallie Krawcheck? Former Merrill Lynch brokerage chief Bob McCann and former Citigroup wealth management head Sallie Krawcheck are both being considered to lead UBS's wealth management unit. Investment News reported that two industry recruiters say both names ""are already being discussed"". Earlier, the Financial Times had reported that UBS's new CEO, Oswald Grubel, had decided not to sell the company's US wealth management business, despite speculation in recent months that he might sell the business following tax evasion charges and the subsequent scandal."
"If the US presidential election were to be decided by social media, Barack Obama would clearly have won this year against Republican candidate Mitt Romney. The Obama campaign has been actively using social media, and the president has a huge advantage in terms of the number of followers on Facebook and Twitter, and a branch of the Democratic National Committee is using private social media tools to communicate with some campaign staff. There is also evidence that the Obama team is using social media analytics to gauge voter sentiment and track the popularity of campaign messages. None of the campaigns contacted to discuss their social media strategies responded to messages."
"Let's take a moment to define what impact investing is. Great! Now that they're gone, we can get down to business. For over four years, I've covered impact investing as a regular contributor to Forbes and written hundreds of articles on the field. Here's the thing: most impact investments are only open to wealthy individuals. This is an impact investing guide for everyone else, the 98 percent of the population that doesn't meet the criteria to invest alongside the wealthy."
"Health authorities have issued another measles warning after a person in a public transport visited two universities and a grocery store while infectious. This warning is the fourth of its kind in recent weeks. The latest infected person visited several public places between Sunday, January 7th, and Wednesday, January 30th. On January 30th: on the train from Aubin Grove to Perth between 10:25-11:15 am, and from Canning Bridge to Mandurah between 2:20-3:15 pm. On bus 100 between Canning Bridge and Cannington between 10:50-11:40 am, and bus 101 from Curtin University to Canning Bridge between 2-2:50 pm."

"Expect sunny weather today as high pressure sets in over the weekend. After a cold start, temperatures will rise into the upper 40s and lower 50s. A cool evening is expected under mostly clear skies. Lows will be in the upper 20s and lower 30s. The wind will be out of the south tomorrow, which means we will see milder temperatures. Expect highs in the upper 50s. Some communities may reach 60. However, thicker clouds develop as the day progresses. It appears the clouds will clear out at night with lows in the upper 30s and lower 40s."
"It looked like a scene after an earthquake. A sea of orange boxes was scattered across the floor, shoes were jammed into every nook, and bewildered people stood in shock. But it was not a natural disaster. It was Black Friday at the Nike store in Seattle. Horrified shoppers at the Seattle Premium Outlets in Tulalip, Washington, shared photos and videos of the store's appalling state after the holiday weekend. They show people recklessly trampling boxes protecting Nike shoes as they walked through the store, mindlessly grabbing and tossing sneakers along the way."
"The 27th annual Franti Southwest Iowa Hot Air Balloon Days is taking place this week in Creston. Hot Air Balloon Committee representative Bill Fastenow says the wind is the determining factor on whether the balloons will fly and, of course, their destination. Fastenow says there will be a pilots meeting today (Saturday) at 4:30 pm, followed by a ""night glow"" at the Creston airport south of town, which he says is quite a sight to see. Creston Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Ellen Gerhart says at least 57 aeronauts have registered to participate in this week's events."

"The unemployment rate in Stark County fell to 6.8 percent in August, the lowest it has been since September 2008. For the first time since 2008, the unemployment rate in Stark County has dipped below 7 percent, and it is likely that a multitude of factors contributed to the decline. The prime suspect is the influx of businesses to the area due to the Utica shale oil and natural gas drilling. Oil exploration companies moved into the area, followed by engineering and construction firms providing a variety of services. Manufacturing also experienced growth due to increased local and national demand for steel and drilling equipment."
"A horror movie celebrity will visit one of Gaston County's scariest spots on Wednesday and Thursday. Actor Derek Mears, who has appeared in ""Friday the 13th"" (2009), ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"", ""Predators"", and ""Men in Black II"", will meet horror fans at a place called the ""Abandoned Mill"" in Belmont. Kevin Blanchfield, the mill's owner, said he tries to offer something new and interesting every year at the location. He expects the appearance of ""Friday the 13th"" character Jason Voorhees to boost weekday attendance. The mill usually draws around 200-300 people on weekday evenings before Halloween."
"WASHINGTON (Alliance News) - Gold prices remained stable on Thursday after the latest Federal Reserve report on the state of the economy showed that businesses across the US have become less optimistic in recent months. Spot gold rose 0.2% to $1,294.11 an ounce, while US gold futures were virtually unchanged at $1,293.75 an ounce. As economic concerns intensify, the Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates at their current level at least until June. The dollar paused today after recent gains, and the pound stabilized after UK Prime Minister Theresa May won a vote of confidence in parliament and urged lawmakers to break the Brexit agreement deadlock."
"President Jacob Zuma believes the Public Protector's report on state capture was a political tool designed to be used against certain individuals. In an exclusive interview with ANN7 on Monday evening, Zuma spoke out about the state capture report by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela, in which she recommended that Zuma establish a commission of inquiry into state capture and that Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng choose the judge to preside over it. The report investigated whether Zuma's friends, the scandalous Gupta family, had undue influence over the executive."
"Why we love it: Few things are as stylish as a good night's sleep. After all, a rested night can make you look fresh - and feel refreshed - in the morning. Maybe one of the main factors that contribute to catching quality sleep is a good mattress. The new mattress, available in sizes from twin to California king, is made of five layers of ""premium"" foam, including a one-inch ""flo"" foam, a 1.5-inch latex foam, a 1.5-inch viscoelastic memory foam, a 1.5-inch high-resilience foam with supportive gel pillows, and more."
"Jenna Barker of Seton Catholic set a sectional record, winning the 1600 meters in 5 minutes 13.04 seconds, and also won the 800 meters, as several local athletes qualified for regionals during the IHSAA girls' track sectional championship on Tuesday at Connersville High School. Other individual sectional champions included Riley Austin of Richmond in the 200 meters and long jump, Nakala Bennett of Richmond in the 100 meters, Hannah Stamm of Seton Catholic in the 3200 meters, and Austin, Lindsey Griffin, Peyton Vanniddlesworth, and Riley Wetzel of Richmond in the 4x400 relay."
"When the theme of the convention seemed to be ""Drill, baby, drill"", which is an energy policy in exactly the same way that ""Tax, baby, tax"" is a fiscal policy (i.e. it doesn't exist), slogans are apparently all that's left to the party. Even if you think that increasing oil exploration and production by drilling offshore makes sense, you can't seriously take these people seriously. Unfortunately, you can. This moment, by the way, was the moment when I became completely disillusioned with the convention."
"The new chair of the National Children's Hospital board has stated that it would be ""a bad thing"" for the state to allow the hospital's main contractor to walk away from their role. Board chair Fred Barry, who is currently appearing before the Oireachtas health committee, also said that from a very early stage in the project there had been an ""underestimation"" of its cost, which has led to the cost overruns to €1.73 billion compared to the initial estimate of €800 million in 2014."
"Bob Cannard turns over compost that originally came from San Francisco's food waste at Green String Farms near Petaluma, California, on Friday, March 6, 2009. As a parent and someone who has worked with parents for many years, I was struck by the front-page article on the heart-wrenching case of an infant's death in El Cerrito (""Toddler's death in car a tragic lesson for all parents,"" June 10). The assumption that parents can ""easily forget that their children are in the back seat"" is, unfortunately, all too true."
"Summary: Southeast Toyota Distributors (SET) is recalling certain model year 2016 Toyota Yaris, Rav4, Land Cruiser, and 4Runner vehicles, as well as Scion FR-S, iM, and TC vehicles, manufactured from January 28, 2016, to March 14, 2016. The affected vehicles may have a label that does not reflect the correct added weight of the installed accessories. As a result, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard number 110, ""Tire Selection and Rims for Motor Vehicles"". Consequence: An incorrect label may lead to vehicle overloading, increasing the risk of a crash."
"An American Civil Liberties Union attorney asked a federal appeals court in San Francisco to block a California law requiring police to collect a DNA sample from anyone arrested on suspicion of committing a serious crime. The law is part of a 2004 voter initiative that gradually expanded the categories of people in the criminal justice system from whom DNA is collected through a cheek swab. Four plaintiffs are challenging the provision, which took effect in 2009 and requires DNA collection from all those arrested on suspicion of a serious crime, regardless of whether they are charged or convicted of the offense."
"Really? Was it that complicated? The Green Bay Press-Gazette reports that authorities claim they are two to three weeks away from completing their investigation into an alleged sexual assault involving Packers cornerback Brandon Underwood. Underwood is being accused by two Milwaukee women of attacking them in the Lake Delton area of Wisconsin, a resort zone, after a charity event. The alleged incident occurred on June 5, and within days of the incident, police officials stated that they doubted any charges would come out of the incident. One of the main issues was that the stories told by the women allegedly changed: initially they accused several Packers players, and then only Underwood."
"A new logo that will help define how the community views the Seminole County school system is soon to be developed, using at least one of the four top-winning designs from the county's logo contest. School board members said they wanted a new logo because the system's current logo - a school stop sign - does not reflect the county's academic achievements. The contest was divided into four age groups: 10 years old and under as the elementary group, 11-14 years old in the junior group, 15-18 years old in the senior group, and 19 years old and over in the adult group."
"LOS ANGELES (AP) - Kings forward Anze Kopitar will undergo surgery on Wednesday to repair a torn ligament in his severely sprained right ankle. An MRI exam on Monday confirmed that the Kings' top scorer needs corrective surgery that will keep him out of the lineup for an indefinite period. Kopitar injured the ankle when he fell awkwardly during the Kings' win over Colorado on Saturday. Coach Terry Murray initially said the Slovenian all-star had broken his ankle and would be out for at least six weeks, but the Kings ultimately determined the injury was a severe ankle sprain. Kopitar leads the Kings with 25 goals and 43 assists."
"Two people were injured in a crash on State Highway 2 near Waikaramarama. What was initially reported as a three-car collision yesterday, police now believe was two separate crashes that occurred almost in the same spot near Apata Station Road. A St John ambulance spokeswoman said two people were taken from the scene to Tauranga Hospital - one in a serious condition and one in a moderate condition. Police were first called to the area at about 1:10pm. ""Two crashes occurred in a short space of time in the same location. It appears a ute went off the road, and then there was a collision between a car and a truck."
"Richard Randolph Lamb, a resident of Dunsmuir, died September 17, 2009 at Mercy Medical Center in Mount Shasta. Richard was born in Fairview, Montana. He moved to Siskiyou County from Oregon in 1919. Richard was a U.S. Navy veteran, serving in the Pacific Fleet during World War II. He worked as a locomotive engineer for Southern Pacific Railroad for 34 years. Richard was a member of the Dunsmuir Veterans of Foreign Wars. His hobbies included bowling, cars, music, travel, and his love for his family."
"The Korean Shipbuilders' Association and Offshore Plant Association released figures that confirm the expectations of many analysts: the number of active shipyards worldwide has decreased by more than 40 percent compared to what it was seven years ago. In the study, an active shipyard was understood to be a facility with at least one vessel in its order book. The number of active shipyards in China decreased from 380 to 140, and in Japan from 70 to 60 during the same period, the association reported. Furthermore, the world's largest shipyards - DSME, Hyundai Heavy, and Samsung Heavy - may face empty yards and unused capacity as early as next year."
"""Interaction of Color"", a 1963 book by Josef Albers, a German artist and educator who taught at the Bauhaus, Black Mountain College, and Yale University throughout his legendary career, is not just for beginning artists. Its fascinating illustrations are a revelation for anyone interested in color theory and human perception. On Thursday, in honor of the book's 50th anniversary, Yale University Press, the publisher of the original edition, will offer a new way to interact with Albers' lessons, releasing the ""Interaction of Color"" app for iPad."
"MELBOURNE, Australia - Defending champion Victoria Azarenka struggled to hold off injured American Jamie Hampton 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 on Saturday before advancing to the fourth round of the Australian Open. Hampton, who needed a medical timeout for a lower back problem before she won the second set, and often grimaced in pain, on the verge of tears throughout the third set, still managed to hit 41 winners to keep the world No. 1 Azarenka under pressure. Azarenka appeared frustrated at times, but overcame an early break and fended off three break points in the seventh game of the deciding set before winning the match in 2 hours, 9 minutes."
"Suzuki revealed improper testing on 6,401 units out of 12,819 since 2012. In a significant blow to the Japanese automaker, Suzuki Motor announced that the company had used improper testing for fuel efficiency and emissions on its vehicles in Japan. According to Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport, Suzuki, along with Mazda and Toyota, admitted to cheating on emissions tests and submitted reports on sample vehicles selected in the quality assurance process. Furthermore, the samples were tested under improper driving conditions. However, the company is currently not considering a product recall."
"Brands should resist the temptation to take on a hot issue in the Super Bowl as a way to stand out, said Aimee Drolet, a professor of marketing and behavioral decisions at the University of California, Los Angeles's Anderson School of Management. ""It's usually not the best platform for it, because the audience is so broad, so you're inevitably going to alienate half the people,"" she said. In other news, UC officials announced that the 10-campus system set a new fundraising record in 2017-18, bringing in more than $2.7 billion."
"Margaret O'Brien, 69, moved from Canada to Wolverhampton in 1971, got married, had three children and spent more than 25 years working for the local council as a dinner lady, a meals on wheels driver, a lollipop lady and a cleaner. A spinal injury a few years ago forced her to quit work, leading to her claiming benefits for the first time. In 2015, she was told her disability payments were being suspended because she was an illegal immigrant. In a letter, she was informed ""of our intention to remove you from the UK to your country of nationality, if you do not depart voluntarily""."
"Let's just stop trying to label them and just be happy. Okay, I'll just say it to everyone who's wondering if Taylor Swift and Calvin Harris are dating: they're just dating. You've probably heard Taylor's song from the 1989 album ""I Know Places"". It's a song about developing a relationship while the paparazzi are chasing them. ""Something happens when everyone finds out/ See the vultures circling, dark clouds/ Love is a fragile little thing, that can slip away"", she sings. Just hang in there, Haylor."
"PARIS (Reuters) - Longchamp, one of France's leading handbag makers, plans to increase its presence in China, its chief executive said, in stark contrast to rivals scaling back and despite an economic slowdown and shift in consumer culture in the country. Many top luxury brands, such as Kering's (PRTP.PA) Gucci and LVMH's (LVMH.PA) Louis Vuitton, are slowing store openings in China as part of campaigns to preserve their exclusive image. ""We are still far from having fully developed China,"" said Jean Cassegrain, the chief executive of the private group, in an interview with Reuters."
"The annual Kelly gang gathering is usually a festive affair. Conceived by New York Post media columnist Keith J. Kelly, the meeting has been held on St. Patrick's Day for the past three years at Langan's pub on 47th Street. Guests - media types and others - celebrate their shared Kelly surname and innate Irishness over corned beef and cabbage and a pint or three of Guinness. But the mood shifted when Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly made an appearance. Donning a green tie, he tried to keep things light: ""The Kellys are fun people,"" he declared."
"NEW YORK — Just minutes before noon on Wednesday, Australian Ambassador and President of the United Nations Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty Peter Woolcott released his final version of the global arms control agreement. After releasing the document, Woolcott informed delegates that they had 24 hours to consult with their respective governments, and then arrive tomorrow for the final vote. For many reasons, the United States delegation should choose the last option. Below are several sections of the proposed agreement, each of which would require the federal government to unconstitutionally infringe on the right of Americans to keep and bear arms protected by the Second Amendment."
"The sixth stage of the Charlevoix Yacht Club's summer series took place on August 8 in conditions of light and variable wind. The race was completed by 22 boats, it consisted of a shortened distance of six windward-leeward stages. Affinity became the fastest boat in the overall standings, and only 26 seconds of corrected time separated the first three boats of the Spinnaker A fleet this week. Two more races and one additional stage will determine the overall result of the summer series. The race results are provided by Mike Miller and Keith Attee, committee chairs. Jib and Main fleet: 1 - Sonnett (Lehman); 2 - Exitus (Pung)."
"A search for the phrase ""toxic mold"" will yield hundreds of scary warnings and ""studies"", but few of them are based on science, and many are motivated by profit. Recently, one of my patients was hospitalized with liver failure due to alcohol. His history of liver disease was well-documented, but he vehemently denied that anyone had ever warned him about the dangers of alcohol. The initial admission of ""a few drinks"" turned into much more with some prodding from various healthcare workers. Despite his liver being in a state of significant shock, he was stable and lucky enough to retain most of his liver function."
"It's easy to lose democratic mechanisms, but hard to get them back, says the future General Secretary of the Lutheran World Federation. Speaking at St Paul's Cathedral in London, Bishop Catherine Jefferts Schori urged Christians to take action against the injustices of the world. The Catholic Church in Scotland is facing questions over plans to charge worshippers to see the Pope during his visit to Glasgow. ""Eleanor's pumpkin has grown so much this week, and she checks on it all the time""."
"(Newser) – After a car fatally struck a 70-year-old pedestrian, the driver's insurance company demanded payment for vehicle repairs – from the dead woman's daughter. Anna Sedenko, a recent cancer survivor, was walking to a bus stop when she was hit by a passing BMW, reports the New York Post. She died two hours later. Police did not issue the driver a ticket, noting that Sedenko was not crossing at a designated crosswalk or intersection. This goes against their stance only because they were criticized. Well, you know...corporations are people, my friend."

"Without much fanfare, but fortunately with a large number of customers, Salisbury quietly opened its central shopping area on Saturday, almost three months after it became the site of an international incident. The Maltings, which connects the bus park to the city center, had been inaccessible to the public and protected by security measures and tents since former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious on one of its benches after being poisoned. Market traders were relocated outside the shopping area by Wiltshire County Council during the decontamination operation."
"It may not be a name that's as on everyone's lips as Roku devices, Chromecast, or Fire TV, but the Nvidia Shield TV is nonetheless a fairly capable media streamer, so much so that it even made it onto our list of the best streamers you can buy. Nevertheless, if you have one, you may start to feel a little jealous when you see Amazon Alexa voice assistant support on other devices left and right. Don't worry, though, as Nvidia has announced that its Android-based streamer will be getting Alexa control support."

He will be able to start talking to potential new clubs in January."
"The search for real estate properties says nothing about community competence or exceptional service. Mobile devices are now the preferred way to interact with the online world, regardless of purpose or content. Video is no longer an option, use it for authentic representation or risk being forgotten. I have a confession to make: I don't attend Inman Connect to network. At least, not in the way most people understand it. As a marketing director for an industry service provider, my day-to-day job is to educate real estate agents. However, when I come to Inman Connect, I get to learn from the agents."

"By detaining Haniyeh, Israel sent a signal that the smuggling of Palestinian money is coming to an end. It is an open secret that Hamas has been smuggling millions of dollars into Gaza through the Rafah Crossing since the international community cut financial aid to the Palestinian Authority after Hamas came to power earlier this year. However, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's decision on Thursday to close the Rafah Crossing to prevent PA Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh from bringing in $35 million into Gaza marked the first time Israel has actively intervened to stop the flow of money."
"TORONTO — Business owners are demanding significant changes to the King Street pilot project, or they will consider other options, including taking legal action, says the head of the Ontario Restaurant Hotel and Motel Association. ORHMA president and CEO Tony Elenis said his group has a meeting with Mayor John Tory this Friday, where they hope to hear that the city will lift restrictions on private vehicle traffic after 7 p.m. and on weekends.

"""Fox & Friends"" gathered an all-male panel to render a verdict on whether women are hiding ""their lady parts"" 

On Tuesday's Fox & Friends morning show, a panel of men was assembled to determine the ""proper etiquette for wearing leggings"", and they did so in the most refined way possible - by showcasing young women in leggings in front of them so they could comment on their appearance.

"Not only did former BP CEO Tony Hayward go sailing on his yacht in the midst of the oil spill crisis, but he also doesn't apologize for it. In his first interview since stepping down as CEO of BP, Tony Hayward told the BBC that seeing his son for the first time in three months was just as important. ""I have to confess that at the time I was pretty angry,"" he said about the fierce reaction from the White House and people in the Gulf of Mexico. ""I hadn't seen my son for three months."""
"It can be said with confidence that Cleveland Browns defensive back and Arizona State University alum Damarious Randall did not expect this kind of response. After the Warriors advanced to the NBA Finals on Monday night and secured a rematch with the Cleveland Cavaliers, Randall made a guarantee on Twitter: ""If the Cleveland Cavaliers win the 2018 NBA finals I'll buy everyone who retweet's this a jersey..."" 
Well, by Wednesday afternoon Randall's tweet had been retweeted over 800,000 times. That's a lot of jerseys - more than Randall could probably afford to give away."
"Elvira Alonso considers waste recycling to be a crucial factor for the future. The director of McAllen's public works department oversees the city's recycling program and ensures its smooth operation. Plastics, cardboard, glass, and other common materials are transported, shredded, or relocated for reuse at the facility on North Bentsen Road. This operation is a profitable and relief-providing service for the public good. Clean streets, quality drainage systems, and maintaining the mission of ""Keep McAllen Beautiful"" are among the services performed in this sector, said Alonso.

"When I arrived to meet Bono at the bar of his hotel, I spotted Richard Gere sitting at a table with a lovely woman in a tiny fur jacket and a leather cap. Bono, on the other hand, had retreated to a quiet back room, where he was chatting with a portly middle-aged white man in a suit and tie. (Bono was dressed in a T-shirt and a fuzzy sweater that needed its sleeve mended.) This was Randall Tobias, the head of the Bush administration's AIDS program. The administration had just announced that the program was providing antiretroviral drugs to 155,000 Africans with AIDS."
"NFL player Keenan Allen spoke out about Bell's song. According to TMZ, in mid-March, Le'Veon Bell, the star running back for the New York Jets, signed a contract with his team for $52.2 million.

"Dundee has long been a city of rich character, great wealth and extreme poverty. If the new V&A can give it a transformational boost, it will be worth every penny. I declare an interest. I was at the fledgling University of Dundee in its last year as St Andrews College, and, like many whose lives have been linked to the city, I have retained a strong affection for the place and its people. Not everyone has loved it. In those days ""clearing"" sent hordes of last-minute applicants to what they fondly anticipated as the secluded life of St Andrews Royal College."

The Chiefs haven't made any announcements about their plans, but it appears there are no plans to let Ford go this offseason. Defensive schemes will likely change with Steve Spagnuolo taking over as defensive coordinator instead of Bob Sutton, but pass-rushers are always valued, and general manager Brett Veach didn't seem ready to part ways with Ford."

"2 people blamed the murdered woman for their problems, recording shows confession: Crime: The confession came to light in the trial of a man accused of killing an Estonian community activist. An Estonian refugee and his alleged accomplice had planned to kill themselves because they were hungry and destitute after being abandoned by the Estonian community, but they decided to kill a woman from North Hollywood first, whom they blamed for their problems, so she wouldn't be able to mock their death.

By their own accounts, they are close to achieving their goal. Could this happen by the end of April? We can't know for sure, as everything is very secretive.

"A new poll shows that more Americans would choose the Internet as their sole news source than television, radio, and newspapers combined, and Internet reports are considered far more reliable than other media. It also shows that only 1 in 200 people polled believe that newspapers will be the dominant source of information in 2014. The poll found that 56 percent of adults nationwide would choose the Internet if they could use only one news source, while television, newspapers, and radio combined received the support of 41 percent.

""What jobs are going to be created by having a bike lane?"" Ohio Republican Steven LaTourette asked. He claimed that sustainability projects had ""stolen"" $300 million from other programs and personally attacked La!Hood for his biking advocacy."
"How the internet caught up with the world. The early web: the UNIX team was great, if you knew what you were doing. This month the World Wide Web turned 20, and its birthday was marked around the globe. It was a pleasant change, as a medium once hailed as a new frontier of hope had since the Cambridge Analytica scandal been viewed with suspicion. We had spent years being outraged by the possibility that our choices of washing machines and underwear were being influenced by clever web advertising, and in 2018 we learned that even voters' choices were open to manipulation."
"The crowd's response to the bombs at the finish line, I think, was exemplary. Of course, many people ran away from the blasts, and quite understandably. But a remarkable number of people ran towards the shots, as they say, even though when two bombs go off, you can expect more. Many of these people were professionals. The finish line of a marathon is a convenient place for a blast, as it is where the doctors, police, ambulances, and so on are located. Some soldiers happened to be on the scene. But others were not professionals."
"BATON ROUGE, LA (WAFB) - Golfers in Baton Rouge may have fewer places to tee off after the results of a study aimed at improving public courses were released, recommending the number of courses be reduced from seven to five.

"VIDEO: On March 30, 2017, drivers in Atlanta on the northbound I-85 found themselves in an astonishing situation when materials stored under an overpass spanning Piedmont Road and Monroe Drive caught fire and the overpass collapsed. Despite the 2017 I-85 bridge collapse that threw Atlanta into a two-month transportation nightmare - or the massive sinkholes that have occurred throughout the city - Georgia's infrastructure is actually one of the best in the country, according to researchers at 24/7 Wall Street, who created an index using the share of potentially hazardous bridges, roads, or dams to determine which states have the worst infrastructure."
"Sanford already has private attorneys. Garber said he was hired to defend the institution of the governor's office and to help lawmakers realize the gravity of their deliberations. ""The eyes of the world are on South Carolina,"" Garber said Tuesday, adding that lawmakers' decision on whether to impeach Sanford would have implications for future governors of South Carolina and for the state. Garber said Sanford's disappearance for five days in June for a secret visit to his lover in Argentina did not rise to the high standard required for impeachment. The state constitution says serious crimes or other serious misconduct are the only grounds for impeachment."
"The Prime Minister of Israel stated that he would deliver a major policy speech on achieving peace with the Palestinians. The Prime Minister has so far refused to agree to the White House's demands for a complete halt to settlement expansion, without exceptions.

"The most likely source came through for the Boston Red Sox on Sunday. David Ortiz, never one to shy away from a big moment, hit a three-run homer off Joba Chamberlain in the ninth inning, giving the Red Sox a 5-3 win over the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park. The victory snapped a five-game losing streak for Boston and halted a string of seven straight series that had ended 3-0. Ortiz's heroics obviously propelled the Red Sox to victory. But there was plenty else to Sunday's win, so let's take a look at some notes from the nationally televised affair."
"Two mental health advocacy groups want to know which Vermont doctors received thousands of dollars in gifts from pharmaceutical companies last year. Companies may be able to withhold some names under a law protecting trade secrets. The groups argue that this loophole needs to be closed. Last year, Vermont doctors and other healthcare providers received about $3.1 million in gifts from pharmaceutical companies. Vermont is one of the few states that requires pharmaceutical companies to disclose such marketing expenses. The payments include consulting fees, travel, gifts, and lecture payments."

"Everyone knows where and what they were doing when that nightmare story known as 9/11 occurred. Chuck was getting ready for work, and I was at the computer watching FOX when those terrible images appeared. I had the TV on mute, so I only saw the flames coming out of one of the towers in New York. I turned on the sound, and the words were incomprehensible. For some reason, even before I knew why and what, tears welled up in my eyes. It's funny how your instincts take over your mind, even before it realizes what's happening."

"Although giant and spectacular circus shows now tour the globe, it's worth remembering how they evolved from what was essentially street theatre. This Colombian acrobatic collective, comprising a dozen young performers presenting the world premiere of their latest show, is one of the main attractions of the now well-established Showzam festival in Blackpool, held over the February half-term week, featuring acts from around the world. Circolombia go on to London after five days of performances here, but nothing will quite compare to seeing them in the plush surroundings of the circus big top, situated at the foot of Blackpool Tower."

Al-Shabaab started tweeting in English on Wednesday, using the handle @HSMPress. (HSM is the English acronym for al-Shabaab's more grandiose name, Harakat al-Shabaab al-Mujahideen.) Jack Dorsey and company have yet to verify the account, but it sounds pretty authentic: one of the middling tweets said that the terrorists ""welcomed"" the surrender of seven Somali government soldiers after they ""pronounced repentance for apostasy""."
"Patrick Warburton, the actor who played the role of David Puddy in the TV series ""Seinfeld"", attended the Devils' game on Wednesday evening to support the team in the fourth game of the first round series against the Lightning.

Krzysztof Bauta, known to his parishioners as Father Chris, said he was called into the bishop's office on Wednesday and told he was being removed from serving at St. Joseph's parish.

"The weight loss company has seen its stock price plummet 66 percent since November 2015, when the former talk show host announced she would become the face of the company. As Oprah Winfrey and other board members search for a new CEO of Weight Watchers International (WTW), analysts tracking the company have put forth some suggestions on the top priorities for a successful turnaround. Neither Chambers nor the company has commented on the reason for her sudden departure from the company. Weight Watchers' stock fell more than 7 percent in after-hours trading yesterday after the announcement, before retreating."

The statement essentially ruined the summer vacation season in the state. This time, travel and tourism representatives want potential visitors to know that less than one percent of public lands were affected by the wildfires. When Owens made his statement, Colorado had 24 million visitors who spent about $7 billion a year. Denver had 10 million visitors who spent about $2.3 billion.

"Thomas Duffy is a sculptor who is preparing a memorial bronze monument to honor the memory of his father, whom he never knew. Thomas is the son of Tommy Duffy, who was killed in December 1972, when a car bomb exploded on Sackville Place in Dublin. He was born just a few months after the horrific events and knew his father only from the stories of family members who knew him.

But Battles lost his love for the game last year and left after just two weeks of training camp with the Buffalo Bills."
"When George Orwell wrote ""1984"", he incorporated into it his vision of the future where people would communicate in a language called Newspeak. Orwell described Newspeak as ""the only language in the world whose dictionary shrinks every year"". Orwell's idea with Newspeak was to create a world where all shades of meaning would be removed from language, which would reinforce the State's total dominance. Naming something with one word when in fact it is its complete opposite can also be an example of Orwellian Newspeak, for example when a bill full of spending on liberal social programs is called a plan for economic stimulus."
"A woman was threatened when a stranger approached her on the street in Lindfield yesterday afternoon. Police said the woman was walking along Barncroft Drive in Lindfield between 4:45pm and 5:30pm yesterday when she was grabbed by a white-bearded man aged around 40-50 years.

"It's hard not to be impressed with Lego Cuusoo: the site does a great job of bringing together the Lego fan community to create interesting designs for future sets. Who wouldn't encourage people of all ages to be creative? Lego and the geek community go hand in hand, so when Ladyada's workshop is proposed as a set, it's hard not to get a little excited. Adafruit Industries produces and sells equipment that's easy to use (such as special Arduino kits), to inspire people of all ages and experience levels to work with electronics.

"Most Indians don't ride horses and wear feathers, but in the movies they always do. Look at the story of the real crazy men and women who changed the way we feel, see, and buy. Pioneer Mary Wells on how to make 1960s advertising fun. Advertiser George Lois on advertising, Ali, and changing the world. Bill Bernbach - the man who combined art and copywriting in an agency. Hal Riney talks about the innovative Saturn car advertising campaign. ""Welcome to KPL, life in a nutshell. It may be heaven, it may be hell."""
"If this was supposed to be a benchmark game for the Flyers, they came up a bit short. Coming off a 12-1-1 stretch starting on January 12, the Flyers ran into a wall named the Tampa Bay Lightning on Tuesday night, and it was a real gut check. The team with the best record (46-11-4) in the NHL easily handled the Flyers en route to a 5-2 win at the Wells Fargo Center, winning all their games this season. With Pittsburgh's win in New Jersey, the Flyers fell back to eight points out of a playoff spot."
"The second part of Naomi Klein's report on the events that triggered the emergence of a new kind of politics in Argentina. Until quite recently, Argentina had a policy of official forgetting regarding the crimes of the Dirty War. Of course, non-profit human rights organizations continued to publish numerous damning reports, the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo still held marches, and the children of disappeared parents would periodically appear at the homes of former military officials to throw paint. But until the Argentinazo, most middle-class Argentines viewed such actions as gloomy rituals of a bygone era."

Incoming President Donald Trump earlier in the week tweeted to Republican lawmakers to ""be careful"". To break it down, 20 percent of those surveyed want the law to be repealed immediately and the details worked out later, while another 28 percent say repeal should wait until a replacement plan is announced, the Kaiser foundation said."
"South Dade will be seeking to win its sixth consecutive state championship in 3A this weekend. South Dade enters the FHSAA state wrestling tournament this weekend as the favorite to win a sixth consecutive 3A team title, but not by the same margin they have been in recent seasons. The Buccaneers are led by reigning state champions Brevin Balmeceda, Brettley Renaud, and Todd Perry. Tyler Orta, Joshua Swan, and Eric Temes have all finished on the podium before and their performances this weekend will be crucial in securing South Dade another team title."
"On the NSE, Nestle shares rose by 5.35% to Rs 6185.05. On the BSE, the shares jumped by 5.23% to Rs 6180.

"Representative Francis D. Gibson speaks on the Inland Port Authority bill he sponsored as Utah lawmakers gathered in the State Capitol building in Salt Lake City for a special session on Wednesday, July 18, 2018.

Jenner did appear in a Calvin Klein ad with her sisters last week, but her stomach was covered to conceal any possible baby bump."
"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio isn't scheduled to visit Israel until August, but that doesn't mean he can't get hands-on and dance with Hasidic Jews beforehand. The mayor may not have known all the words, but as the video below shows, he definitely got into the spirit of ""Heveinu Shalom Aleichem"" and ""Am Yisrael Chai"" at Sunday's Celebrate Israel parade in New York. He's far from the first politician to dance with Chabad - you can watch video of the Texas governor"

"Gaza is the world's largest prison. Almost two million Palestinians are locked in there by an Israeli military blockade. Last year, racist Israel killed over 2,000 Palestinians in Gaza, including 547 children. The Pentagon rushed in more bombs when the Zionist state ran out of ammunition. Baltimore, like Palestine, is under racist military occupation. The Baltimore police department - the sixth largest in the 26th largest US city - treats black people like inmates. According to the 2010 US census, although 72 percent of Baltimore's population are people of color, 46 percent of police officers are white."

With cold, without water, and without certainty, the character of each family member begins to change, revealing the tension that each of them has been hiding. Selva (13) discovers that death is just shedding our skin, we can become wolves, goats, shadows, or anything that our imagination allows."
"The study suggests that complex behaviors were transmitted tens of thousands of years ago. Despite intensive scientific research, there are still significant gaps in our knowledge of early human life. One of the main questions that remains unanswered is: when did humans first become capable of complex cognition? In other words, when did early humans develop complex cognitive abilities such as prioritization and cultural transmission that we can recognize today? A new study published in the journal Nature sheds light on this topic; after six years of excavations, archaeologists discovered technologically advanced stone tools created around 71,000 years ago."

"WASHINGTON - RFK Stadium, once and future home of major league baseball in the nation's capital, doesn't look like a field of dreams just yet. It's configured for football, not baseball. The field needs to be replaced, and the dugouts, clubhouses, and press box need to be renovated. On a rainy day last week, a quarter of the field was mud and tire tracks. It all looked like Vince Lombardi should be coaching football here - which he did, for the Washington Redskins, in 1969."

Millennials want healthy food and are willing to pay more for it. Wait, no – millennials are in debt and want healthy food at affordable prices. They are also selfish. But they are creative and tech-savvy, so that's good. And don't even try to use traditional advertising with them, stick to social media. If all of this sounds familiar, it's because this is just a small glimpse into the countless contradictory reports about millennials."

"To the watching world, the sight of Britain in flames this week must have been shocking. The looting and arson have shown an inner London, Birmingham, and Manchester that is rarely seen in England, usually presented for export through softly focused period dramas, Hugh Grant movies, or the Will and Kate story. If this revelation has bewildered outsiders, it has no less perplexed the British themselves. The mood here is a mix of anger, fear, and bewilderment. Not that we are unaccustomed to riots: we are. England was ablaze during another royal wedding year, 1981."

"New research suggests that mice with induced symptoms similar to Alzheimer's disease showed improved cognitive function when administered a synthetic hormone similar to estrogen. ""This synthetic hormone improved behavior about as well as estrogen,"" said study leader Christian Pike, associate professor of gerontology at the University of Southern California. However, unlike estrogen, which thickens the uterus and is a known risk factor for endometrial and breast cancer, the synthetic hormone, called PPT, caused no apparent changes in the reproductive system of the animals. ""This could be a promising strategy for maximizing the benefits of hormone therapy while minimizing its risks,"" Pike said."

"Forget about announcing your latest album with a gigantic, expensive outdoor concert - Oasis is hiring street performers to do the heavy lifting of promotion. A group of street musicians and performers were gathered on Friday to perform Oasis' new songs at various locations around Manhattan. This motley crew included violinists, guitarists, and - we can only hope - some of those gold-painted human statues. From subway platforms to park lawns, they played across all five boroughs - even in the pouring rain. Tom and Dominic Di Principe were among those who got soaked in the rain."
"At her weekly therapy sessions, Julie shared her most unpleasant secrets: depression, debt, childhood sexual abuse. Her psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital would then type a brief summary into Julie's computerized medical record. After that, more than 200 pages of confidential notes became available to any doctor who treated her within the vast Partners HealthCare system. She only found out when one doctor later referred to the notes. Julie, a 43-year-old lawyer, was first worried, then angry. ""The details are nobody's business,"" she said. But Partners disagrees."
"To engage the private sector in the healthcare system, a significant increase in government investment is indeed required to cover a larger number of people. The country has a new health policy after 14 years. The very presence of such a long gap indicates the priority, or the lack of it, accorded to a sector that requires urgent attention and has deep linkages with the country's aspiration to grow faster and become a strong economy in the global order. The new policy has proposed seven key changes in the organization of healthcare services, including the desirable change of primary care from selective to assured comprehensive care with linkages to referral hospitals providing services."
"The CEO of Vodafone Hutchison Australia (VHA), Inaki Berroeta, has attempted to temper expectations about the imminent arrival of 5G networks in Australia, saying that while his company is moving forward, he does not expect consumer devices to hit the market until the end of 2019. Berroeta declined to discuss any spectrum plans for Australian 5G, instead emphasizing that a new ""ecosystem"" for mobile technology needs to be created before operators start promoting products. He said he expects the ""bulk of the market"" to launch 5G within a one- or two-month period when it does happen."
"SHENANDOAH -- A church in Schuylkill County is preparing to honor the late Father Walter Ciszek, S.J. this weekend. He was a priest from Shenandoah who is being considered for sainthood. So much has changed at the Father Walter Ciszek Prayer Center in Shenandoah. It's a museum that tells the story of Father Ciszek's life. He was a Jesuit missionary in the Soviet Union, accused of being a Vatican spy, and was held captive until he was returned to the United States in 1963. He died in 1984 at the age of 80.

"I've just remembered why I quit financial journalism after 11 years in the business, including a stint as a Wall Street correspondent. While the world of finance had its charms, I grew increasingly disillusioned with the dominant narrative that always boiled down to money, rather than other factors such as values and social impact, which never seemed to register on the radar. It's not entirely surprising, given the testosterone-fueled trading floors and the fact that there's very little connection between the decisions made by city bosses and their impact on the lives of ordinary people."
"A report to be released on Tuesday will describe how an unknown cyberhacker breached computers in South Carolina and stole millions of tax returns from residents over several years.

"Syria: Why is Assad advancing? In the presidential election held in early June, Assad was declared the winner, gaining 88.7% of the vote. This is not surprising, given the nature of the regime. However, despite the fact that these elections were not ""free"" in any way, and that many people were unable to vote because they were in refugee camps outside the country, it turned out that a significant part of the population supports Assad. Why is this the case? Stop the criminal attack on Gaza! Yesterday, the Israeli army launched a ground offensive on Gaza."
"Butler made headlines last week after posting a signed letter from Barack Obama on her website. In the letter, Butler was described as ""bright, intelligent and determined"".

"BlackBerry has decided not to renew T-Mobile's license to sell its products. The action, which backfired last month, led to BlackBerry severing ties with T-Mobile after many years of partnership. BlackBerry announced on Wednesday that it would not renew T-Mobile's license to sell its products when it expires on April 25. T-Mobile had offended the Canadian phone manufacturer in February when it sent a message to its BlackBerry users offering them an iPhone 5s for $0 down.

"On November 17, 2015, at 12:55 at night.
Michael Höppner had to give up the sophistication of Manhattan streets. We realized we were paying an arm and a leg in Manhattan. We looked everywhere. We ended up in this neighborhood, and the houses here are just stunning, and everything seemed a lot nicer. The people who sold us this house, Rodney and Desmond, live next door. They already had a few offers. I think part of what happened was that they wanted us to be their neighbors: a pregnant couple trying to buy their first home. I'm sure that was probably more appealing than 0.1 percent more on the down payment or something like that."
"Mickey Boodaei has been a leading entrepreneur in the security space for many years. He co-founded Imperva, which went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2011, and co-founded Trusteer, which was acquired by IBM in 2013 for $1 billion. Shortly after the latter acquisition, he founded Transmit Security. Notably, Boodaei did so without taking venture capital, pointing out that putting his own money (as well as that of co-founder Rakesh Loonkar) into the startup felt similar to when he founded his first companies, but in this case, there was no one else to answer to."

"Can drainage pipes solve the compact conflict? How do we get more water into the Republican River? Maybe it's simply reworking existing pasture dams with the installation of drainage pipes. 8-12 inch diameter pipes would allow rainfall to slowly drain out of pasture dams and be directed into the Republican River. Note: This solution does not remove any of the pasture dams as they provide a valuable service to us, it just reworks them. The pipes can be installed at a level that allows water to remain for livestock, wildlife, etc."

"WASHINGTON — South Florida has long been a proving ground for some of the toughest political games in the country, with tactics such as creating phantom candidates by rival politicians to draw votes away from their opponents, or so-called ""boleteras"" hired to illegally fill out stacks of ballots for voters forced to vote by mail, mostly the elderly or disabled.

"Hull - Where the US goes, the UK often follows. This is particularly true of negative phenomena. If extreme weather occurs in the US, we usually experience similar events within a few days. If violent crime increases on the other side of the ocean, it does in the UK as well. Then there's the shopping riot. The UK adopts traditional American activities, such as Christmas Eve sales, which leave customers with empty wallets and a variety of unnecessary goods. Black Friday has passed, and today is Cyber Monday. Each of these has become a major shopping day on both sides of the ocean."

The project has now been picked up by The Weinstein Company, and although Eminem is technically still attached, he may be on the verge of being replaced by one of the biggest stars."

""The polls are open! Come on in!"""
"As a veteran of the climate change movement, I had been conditioned to expect disappointment. So when, as the coordinator of Fossil Free Stanford's administration, I was summoned to the office of Stanford University's senior assistant to the president in early May, I approached the meeting with trepidation. There were good reasons for my concern. That same morning, Harvard University had arrested a student demanding an open dialogue about divesting from fossil fuels. The previous fall, Brown University had flatly refused to meet student demands to sever ties with thirteen of the dirtiest coal companies. Efforts to implement climate policy at the national and international level had fared no better."

"The airline operates 744 mainline aircraft, which vary in size and can carry anywhere from 50 to 366 passengers each. For a typical 737 aircraft, which seats 179 passengers, the reduction in fuel consumption would mean a saving of around 11 pounds per flight. According to the article, discontinuing the sale of duty-free items on board, such as ""spirits, chocolates, and perfumes"", also allowed for a saving of 1.4 million gallons of fuel per year, which brought United Airlines a saving of $2.3 million. It is likely that this also means that United Airlines was making less than $2.3 million from selling these items on board, or calculated that allowing passengers to purchase them on the ground would not have a significant impact on its revenues."
"According to the data presented in the World Economic Forum's ""Global Enabling Trade Report 2012"", the country's macroeconomic foundations are strong, making it attractive to at least some foreign investors concerned about the euro crisis.

"The yield on US government debt rose on Friday after the US government stated that job creation in March was stronger than expected, but wages grew at a slow pace. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.538%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond climbed to 2.947%. Bond yields move inversely to prices. Job creation surged in March after a weak February, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by 196,000, according to a Labor Department report released on Friday. The unemployment rate remained at 3.8%, in line with expectations."
"The Duchess of Sussex's wardrobe may cost a king's ransom, but your's doesn't have to. The Meghan Markle effect is in full swing — or, perhaps, full term. Since the Duchess of Sussex — who is due to give birth to her first child within the next month — announced her pregnancy last fall, fashion watchers have been scrutinizing her every public move, with great interest in what she wears and how she pulls it off. Such scrutiny is nothing new for Markle, whose style has become iconic since she stepped into the royal spotlight."
"Trisha Pollard believes that Texas' social services system relies too heavily on the courts to combat Medicaid fraud and not enough on a tool that was handed to her nearly nine years ago: background checks. ""It all seems so simple,"" Pollard said on Tuesday. ""People in other areas of life regularly undergo background checks."" The 52-year-old former attorney stumbled upon the issue last fall when she served on the Harris County grand jury. During her term, Pollard and other grand jury members handed down indictments against two Medicaid providers, each with a criminal history, including involvement in Medicaid fraud."
"Jennifer Garner spotted on a stroll with son Samuel! Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck have yet to debut photos of their three-month-old son Samuel, but this afternoon Jen stepped out for a stroll in Pacific Palisades, California, with her little treasure… which, of course, was all bundled up! The beaming mom took her baby boy to a pediatrician appointment and was all smiles as she pushed him in his stroller. She even leaned in to coo over Samuel, who is undoubtedly just as charming as his big sisters Violet and Seraphina."
"In Yemen, Tunisia, Egypt, and Gaza, demonstrations erupted over a US-made film that insults Prophet Muhammad. The film, released on Youtube, which is considered blasphemous, has sparked violent protests and attacks on US diplomatic missions in several countries. Here, a Palestinian burns a US flag during demonstrations in Gaza City on September 12. Protesters, outraged by the anti-Islamic film, storm the US embassy in the capital of (***) Yemen.

"The Momtract from Mother New York agency gives command rights instead of flowers or cards. The advertising agency Mother New York has an offer to gift your mother, just in time for Mother's Day. Why not give your mother control over some aspect of your life? The Momtract, which they call ""America's premier legally binding gift"", gives your mother authority over one issue in your life. The Momtract is based on the idea that mothers actually want control, not candies or flowers."
"Zoho offers a total of 43 different applications in its Zoho One cloud suite, but the company has even more projects in development, and it is heavily relying on artificial intelligence and a new partnership strategy in individual industries to drive further growth. PLEASANTON, California - Despite operating in the shadow of larger competitors in the software as a service space, such as Microsoft, Salesforce, and Google, Zoho has managed to deliver impressive customer growth for its well-known Zoho One suite of applications. The growth from 25 million users last year to over 35 million within a year is notable, as is the fact that Zoho has signed up more than 250,000 companies or organizations as paying customers."
"The spat between the US intelligence agencies and the democratically elected President Donald Trump is not only strange but also for this reason is an unusual case for assessing the mandate that should define the relationship between national intelligence and political leadership in a democratic system. Ideally speaking, the national security system based on intelligence performs a sovereign function of detecting and tracking any threat to national security - internal or external - with a view to neutralizing it in time. At the same time, however, it does so on the authority of the elected political leadership, which is the supreme custodian of all sovereign powers in a democracy."
"The Australian men's water polo team was within reach of a major upset, losing to three-time defending champions Hungary 10-9 in the classification semifinals and will now fight for seventh place on Sunday. As they have shown many times throughout this Olympic campaign, Australia is only a goal or two away from beating the world's top teams on a regular basis. They seriously challenged tournament favorites Serbia in the semifinals before giving up a three-goal lead late in the game, and today they were leading with five minutes left to play."
"The Sparks added the necessary inside strength to their lineup when they completed a three-way trade with the Charlotte Sting and the Sacramento Monarchs. Center Rhonda Mapp and guard E.C.

"MBOMBELA - National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete on Saturday appealed to parents in general to be ""approachable"" so their children could open up and express their feelings to them. Mbete was speaking to about 3 000 mourners at the Ka-Nyamazane Stadium in Mbombela, Mpumalanga, during the funeral service of Noxwezi Mthembu, the daughter of ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu. ""There is a sense among our children that we, as parents, want to determine who they should be,"" said Mbete. Noxwezi had taken her own life by hanging herself on the curtains in her room at the parliamentary village of Pelican Park in Cape Town on March 20."
"It's a long way from Billings, Mont., to Lincoln, Neb. – anywhere from 850 to 902 miles, depending on which road you take. But it's precisely this journey that a grizzled and slightly disheveled Woody Grant has just embarked on in the opening shots of Alexander Payne's new film, the Nebraska native. Payne has been nominated for directing and writing awards by the organizers of both the Oscars and the Golden Globes, and he won the gold for writing for ""The Descendants"", ""Sideways"", and ""About Schmidt""."
"KENTON, Delaware - a cheese plant in Kenton, shut down by the Food and Drug Administration due to a listeria outbreak, had been inspected 10 times since 2000. An FDA representative says that during that period, the presence of listeria was never detected at Roos Food's Inc. facility. The agency also never received any complaints. The latest outbreak sickened eight people, seven of them in Maryland and one who died in California. FDA inspectors found numerous violations inside and outside the plant during an inspection that took place from February 18 to March 4, 2014."
"England has called up Fulham goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli, who has yet to receive a call-up to the national team, for matches against Spain and Switzerland, while midfielder Adam Lallana has withdrawn from participation. Bettinelli, 26, was not included in Fulham's squad for the first two games of the season but was able to regain his place in the team. First-choice goalkeeper Jordan Pickford did not participate in the team's main training session on Tuesday. Lallana returned to Liverpool to undergo an examination due to a groin injury.

"The extraordinary mummified remains of a 50-year-old woman, found in a fetal pose, are to be put on display at a museum in France. According to The Independent, the 1,000-year-old mummy was discovered in 2012 in the ancient Peruvian settlement of Pachacamac near Lima. The French archaeologists who found the mummy, curled up in a fetal pose, carefully preserved the integrity of the remains, leaving them in the same position they were found.

"Guernsey voters are set to elect politicians from a single island-wide constituency rather than the current system of districts. More than half of voters backed the change in the island's first-ever referendum, which had a 45% turnout. Option A - a single island constituency - won with 6,017 votes, making up 52% of the total. This means all 38 Guernsey deputies will be elected by a single vote on the same day every four years, starting from June 2020. More Guernsey stories and the latest referendum news. Deputy and Option A supporter Carl Meerveld said he was ""delighted and relieved""."

"The central element of the reconstruction is a warehouse built in 1943, according to the date scribbled on the concrete. It is made of wood. The roof leaks. There is no air conditioning, let alone a cold storage room for fresh fruits and vegetables. The warehouse should have been demolished a long time ago. But those who work at the Powerello House continued to work as they always did, making do with very little. When it rains, it pours inside. Extreme temperatures spoil our food.

""I told him that I know I've done the best I could. I feel good about the 29 years I've spent with the Cowboys. But it's a bad way to end."
"There are plenty of reasons to be skeptical about the ""smart home"" in its current form, but Amazon's virtual assistant Echo shows glimpses of real potential. Here's why. I roll my eyes at the concept of a ""smart"" refrigerator. I don't need my fridge to tweet to let me know I'm out of marmalade. A ""smart"" toaster? I mock it. And ""smart"" locks on your front door seem like a particularly silly idea - unless you're eager for the company of burglars. I get why you might want a ""smart"" thermostat, like Nest, but the hype surrounding it may be overvalued."

"It was a situation that puzzled many around the world, not to mention the passengers on board the British Airways plane. Yesterday, a British Airways passenger plane that was supposed to fly from London to Düsseldorf landed in Edinburgh by mistake after its pilots were given the wrong flight plan. Flight BA3271 was operated by German company WDL Aviation - which was responsible for the plane and cabin crew - on behalf of BA under a leasing agreement. One possibility, as is believed, is that on Sunday the plane had flown to Edinburgh and back on its previous flight, and so the same flight plan was repeated again on Monday morning."

"The Saturday night game was a carbon copy of the Friday night game for the Amarillo Bulls in terms of score and outcome, and if they play another game like this, they won't have any more games. For the second straight night at the Amarillo Civic Center Complex Cal Farley Coliseum, the Bulls ultimately fell to the Corpus Christi IceRays in the end. This time it was in overtime, as Corpus Christi's Kyle Moore scored on a 77-second overtime goal that gave the Bulls a 6-5 loss in the South Division semifinals of the North American Hockey League."

"Maenga is disappointed with your press release against the apology statement from UTM president Saulos Chilima. If you think Malawi is still living in the past where your police would lie to the country that Robert Chasowa took his own life when in fact your party killed him, you are sadly mistaken. Malawi today is not ready to tolerate nonsense. A few weeks ago when your party was terrorizing the nation, your president Peter Mutharika could not utter a word. Under pressure, President Mgeme Kalirani was tasked to issue a statement which did not meet the expectations of the nation. Up to now, your government has not revealed the identities of the terrorists nor arrested them."
"The taxi-hailing service is returning to Taiwan with a revamped business model that it claims will comply with local regulations this time around. Uber suspended its services in Taiwan two months ago, but plans to resume them this Thursday. It turns out that Uber is unstoppable, and Taiwan just found that out. The global taxi-hailing service will resume operations in the country this Thursday after a two-month hiatus, according to the Central News Agency. Uber ceased operations in Taiwan in February after being fined nearly $36 million under a new law that bans unlicensed taxi services."

The Florence Fire/EMS said all occupants got out before crews arrived. One resident was taken to a local hospital for evaluation, officials said. There were no reports of injuries to firefighters."
"With the economy beginning to slow down, Ben Bernanke's war against the nation's savers continues. Some of these funds are even paying juicy double-digit yields - like the one my Permanent Wealth Investor subscribers earned 20% on over two years. Dividend capture funds: these funds buy stocks in companies that are about to pay a dividend, and then sell the stocks after the dividend is paid. By doing this, they can switch between companies with different pay dates, thereby achieving a high dividend payout. The problem is that stocks usually trade lower after the dividend is paid, by the amount of the dividend."

"This clears the way for debt agencies to charge higher fees for overdue loans. According to an analysis released on Tuesday by the Consumer Federation of America (CFA), millions of Americans are behind on student loan payments. Data obtained from the US Department of Education shows that 42.4 million people in the US had $1.3 trillion in federal student loan debt by the end of 2016. Since 2013, the average debt per borrower has increased by 17 percent.

"DENVER (AP) — The nonpartisan administrator of the Colorado state Senate has warned staff, aides, and interns that policy prohibits them from talking to journalists about workplace issues — including sexual harassment. KUNC-FM reported Tuesday that Senate Secretary Effie Ameen sent two emails reminding workers that giving interviews to journalists is a violation of the chamber's policy. Ameen sent the emails in February and March, when Republican leadership in the Senate was insisting that complaints of misconduct and harassment of lawmakers at work should either be handled confidentially — in accordance with the legislative body's workplace harassment policy — or referred to law enforcement."
"It was a Saturday morning, August. I remember it very vividly. I was on the internet, sitting in bed, browsing, not looking for anything in particular. One article caught my attention: it was about the refugee crisis. Men, women, and children were risking their lives to get to Western Europe, and many were dying in the process. It was a story of resilience and horrific trauma. In response, I expected compassion, a surge of solidarity. But my heart sank as I read the comments. There was so much cruelty."
"A Central American referee, Carlos Batres, fell for the worst simulation of the World Cup, committed by the most theatrical Italian since Federico Fellini, thereby depriving New Zealand's ""All Whites"" of a famous victory over the reigning world football champions. The scenes were reminiscent of Australia's defeat by Italy at the 2006 World Cup, when ten Italian players managed to score a penalty in injury time after Fabio Grosso fell following a collision with defender Lucas Neill. Fabio Grosso falls after being hit by defender Lucas Neill during the 2006 World Cup. Don't be fooled - Italy, four-time world champions, did not fairly earn their way back into the game."

"The traditionally conservative Michelin guide, celebrating its 100th anniversary and a new, slimmer look for its mascot, Bibendum, was generous with the stars in France and Switzerland this year. On March 2, three French restaurants were elevated to the highest level in the ratings, three stars. Alain Ducasse's Louis XV restaurant in Monte Carlo regained its third star, which it had lost last year, giving Mr. Ducasse a total of six stars; his second three-star restaurant in Paris bears his name. Pierre Gagnaire, whose restaurant also bears his name, regained his third star, which he had lost two years ago when he moved from St. Etienne to Paris."
"He looked the part in jeans and with his muscles toned. Many fans believe the nickname was an unpleasant consequence of his success at the time.

"The Internet has changed more in the last five years than anyone could have anticipated. It is no longer just a browsing medium: it's filled with Web 2.0 applications, real-time challenges, and a whole range of threats designed to exploit this new usage. As a result, web security has changed incredibly - it's no longer enough to just block, stop, or restrict IP sessions. Web filtering alone can't solve the security problem. This webinar will explain how Internet usage has changed and how your IT perceptions may not match what your users are actually doing, resulting in your security measures being defeated."
"The fourth episode of Aaron Sorkin's series ""The Newsroom"" is titled ""I'll Try to Fix You"". This can be considered the title of the entire series. Like Sorkin's ""The West Wing"", the show wants to fix America, this time through the story of Will McAvoy (Jeff Daniels), a successful, cynical, and boring cable news anchor who decides that he, and journalism, and yes, democracy, can do better.

"The Israeli ambassador and nearly the entire staff were evacuated from the country's embassy in Jordan's capital, Amman, amid growing concerns of an attack on the diplomatic mission similar to last year's assault in Egypt. Fears of violent anti-Israel protests, similar to those that erupted in Cairo, were sparked by calls for a ""million-man march"" on the Israeli embassy in Amman. The action, planned for Thursday, was organized via Facebook. The slogan ""No Zionist embassy on Jordanian territory"" was posted online earlier this week and has already attracted thousands of pledges to attend the demonstration."
"The Maine State Lottery has selected Fuseideas as its advertising agency, an account that was previously handled by NL Partners of Portland, Maine.

"My daughter, a resident advisor at her college, recently groaned, mentioning that she would probably have to oversee additional foreign exchange students this fall. When I asked why that was bad, she said that foreign exchange students tend to assume Americans are stupid unless proven otherwise. They think Americans haven't traveled as much, or aren't as fluent in foreign languages, or aren't as knowledgeable about world culture. I said what any good American would say: Why don't they just stay home, then? Oh, she replied, they don't think our college is stupid."
"Several students had what can be politely called a ""disagreement"" at Graham Middle School. Kim Davis, one of the school counselors, remains calm and composed, helping to resolve the issue. This is the kind of situation that counselors face all the time across Alamance County, North Carolina, and the entire United States. Davis' determination to do this part of her job well, as well as to launch efforts to help students succeed in middle school, has earned her national recognition. She became a national semifinalist for the 2013 School Counselor of the Year award from the American School Counselor Association, receiving the award earlier this month."
"I strongly urge the Mayor and Council to move forward with preserving the South Central Corridor. It is the only solution that will uphold the will of the voters, not jeopardize Federal Transportation Administration grant funding, and strengthen the value of light rail in Phoenix. Our leaders need to stay the course and continue to support this vital project. It is the only reasonable course of action. In Arizona, all necessary medical specialties are already licensed to provide patients with a comprehensive approach to addressing chronic pain. It is time for medical specialists to work together in the best interests of our patients."

"A local state representative is calling for a fundamental reform of the state's standardized testing system after a ""litany of errors"" he believes plagued the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR) in 2016. Isaac believes school districts should be able to choose from national standardized tests while the state fixes the STAAR test. When the STAAR was last administered in May, issues arose with testing administration, as well as loss or late delivery of testing materials, glitches that erased test results, and mishandling of student private information, according to the press release."

The Abortion Supervisory Committee of New Zealand has appealed a High Court judge's ruling that there are grounds to believe many abortions in the country are unlawful. A certifying consultant can legally authorise an abortion in New Zealand only if they act on a certificate approved by two consultants appointed by the Abortion Supervisory Committee. The appeal also claims the court erred in law in concluding that the committee can form its own opinion on the lawfulness of consultants' decisions to approve or decline an abortion.
"FOXBORO - It's the ""Camelot"" football team extending its unbeaten streak (17-0) into the new year, just one step away from appearing in its fourth Super Bowl in the last seven seasons. The New England Patriots advanced to the AFC Championship game by defeating the Jacksonville Jaguars 31-20 at Gillette Stadium last night. A week from today, Bill Belichick's ""History Boys"" will play either the San Diego Chargers or the Indianapolis Colts at Foxboro for the right to go to Super Bowl XLII in Arizona on February 3. ""We played well enough to win,"" said Belichick. ""Each stage of the playoffs gets tougher and tougher."""
"Johnny Depp has broken his silence about his scandalous involvement in the film ""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald"". Depp has been in his own world for some time now, which has led to very public scandals. The actor was accused of domestic violence by his ex-wife Amber Heard, which has not been well received by Harry Potter fans. The fact that the production and J.K. Rowling left him in the film has left many fans feeling disappointed. When asked about the scandal surrounding his involvement in ""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald"", Johnny Depp did not dodge the question and responded to it."
"RICH CARLGAARD: You should be paying attention to four areas. One of them is financial regulations, which still make it difficult for small businesses to get credit. You have healthcare regulations, which you mentioned, Obamacare is adding cost burdens everywhere you look, around every corner. You have environmental regulations, and that's a whole area that's killing small businesses, especially where I live, in California. California farmers are being ruined by the protection of certain bugs. Then you have labor regulations. Last year we saw the National Labor Relations Board's war against Boeing."
"To provoke a ""sabotage"", foreign actors struck key power plants in the country, which ""had equipment made in Canada"", explained Maria Zakharova, adding that the perpetrators were well aware of ""all the algorithms and vulnerabilities"" of Venezuela's energy system. Venezuela began to suffer from nationwide power outages last week. President Nicolas Maduro called the outages a ""sabotage"" organized by the US. He stated that several ""saboteurs"" had been detained while attempting to interfere with the energy system. Earlier, he accused Washington of plotting to overthrow him, as well as other alleged subversive actions."
"Where were you when you received your 40 Under 40 award? It was 2009, and I had already been working at Grubb & Ellis for nine years. In retrospect, I was a young professional still honing my craft in commercial real estate brokerage, developing my expertise, and refining my client service delivery. What was your most significant accomplishment after receiving the award? While I appreciate the recognition as one of the top producers within the company or in the local market and have achieved high transaction volume annually, I am most proud of my successes on behalf of my clients."

On Thursday, the Palestinian Authority (PA) announced that it is delaying the payment of January salaries to 137,000 government employees by at least two weeks due to post-election budget problems. The PA needs $116 million to cover the monthly payroll. However, after Hamas' victory in the elections last week, Israel stated that it is suspending its monthly tax transfers to the PA, which amount to around $45 million, until further notice."

"The trustees of the Victoria Hall in Settle were celebrating this week after learning they are to receive a grant of more than £200,000 to help with its restoration. It was announced on Wednesday that the Victoria Hall company in Settle is to receive a £201,500 grant for the renovation of the old music hall. Without the grant, many people had feared the building would fall out of use and close. A start date for the restoration work has now been scheduled for July 31. The plans include an extension to give the building a new lease of life as a community centre and theatre."
"Japanese manufacturer Mitsubishi is to take its first major step into the full-size MPV market this summer with the stylish and distinctive new people carrier called Grandis. Although it's not due to arrive here until July, the British importer has revealed pricing details at a very early stage. Full specifications and prices have been announced more than three months ahead of the launch in the clear hope that anyone considering a rival MPV such as the Peugeot 807, Chrysler Voyager or Ford Galaxy will wait to see what the Grandis has to offer."

"In last June, the Tacoma Rainiers team brought a deer mascot Rubarb and a local celebrity ""Epic Saxophone-playing Goliath"" to the roof of Cheney Stadium, where the top league club performs, to carry out a usual trick designed to please the crowd. On the roof was also the Tacoma News Tribune columnist Matt Driscoll, who recently explained how the roof dancing brought his employer and the baseball club thousands of dollars in fines from the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries. But somewhere in the pile of public documents that I eventually got, one email - from one person - helped provide a more complete answer."
"Recently, my elderly mother visited her bank located in the Eastland Shopping Center in West Covina. As she was leaving, a woman with a baby approached her, asking for money to feed her child, and claimed that she had recently arrived from Italy and had no money or means of support. As is often the case with elderly people I've known, she didn't hesitate and gave the woman five dollars. Due to her kind heart, my mom asked her all the details of this sad story. The woman thanked her and moved on to other people in the parking lot."
"The Jaiprakash Hospital is undergoing cosmetic renovations lately, the walls of the wards have been whitewashed, the walls have been painted, etc. New facilities are also being added to the hospital. The outpatient department, pediatric department, women's department, and other hospital premises have been renovated and have a new look. Next in line for renovation is the upper floor of the hospital. The amount allocated by the state government for the hospital's capacity expansion is being used for the renovation. Additionally, 18 lakh rupees have been allocated for further improvement of the hospital."
"Can you put a price on faith? It's a question being asked by churchgoers as the tradition of tithing - giving 10% of one's income to the church - is increasingly being challenged. Opponents of tithing say it's a misinterpretation of the Bible, a man-made practice, not a God-given one. They believe they should be free to donate any amount they choose, and they're arguing with pastors, writing letters, and leaving congregations in protest. In response, some pastors have changed their teachings and abandoned what had been a beloved fundraising method for decades."
"The tide is changing at Frankston, with the Dolphins posting consecutive wins for the first time in almost six years with a 13-point victory over Collingwood at Victoria Park on Saturday. Coach Simon Goosey had a five-year plan to turn the boys into contenders for the finals, and the results are evident. Frankston beat last year's grand finalist Port Melbourne last week and held off fast-finishing Pease on Saturday. The key, Goosey said, was that players were being drafted into the AFL system. Michael Hibberd, Dylan Van Unen and Mark Baguley are at Essendon, and Marcus Marigliani was on the Bombers' list in 2011."
"The sad demise of Indian cinema veteran Kader Khan has left a void in the Hindi industry that can never be filled. Condolences have been pouring in for the celebrated actor and his grieving family since the news broke. The actor, who passed away in a hospital in Canada, was remembered at his funeral, which recently took place in Canada. On Wednesday, family members and fans of the actor gathered in Toronto to pay their last respects. At Kader Khan's funeral in Toronto, Canada, the actor's son Sarfaraz thanked everyone for coming and going through this difficult journey."
"Will Chelsea change their tactics in the match against Arsenal? Judging by his body language, you would never have thought that Chelsea are just two points behind the Premier League table leaders. After the defeat by Sunderland in the League Cup quarter-final on Wednesday, Jose Mourinho looked exhausted, a strange mix of irritability, fatigue and determination. ""We may have to take a step back to become more consistent in defence,"" he said. ""That's what I don't want to do, play more on the counter-attack, but I'm seriously thinking about it."
"TOKYO (AFP) - Nearly half of Tokyo's residents were unable to name a single Paralympian, and international sports officials are worried about the city's readiness to host athletes. With the 2020 Olympics approaching, the Japanese capital has work to do. ""If the Paralympic Games are not successful, the Tokyo Games will not be successful,"" Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike told AFP in a recent interview. So, in a bid to fill stadiums, Tokyo has set about revamping its infrastructure, making its metro system accessible to people with disabilities and urging hotels to check their accessibility for wheelchair users."
"Four-term Governor Terry Branstad is set to officially begin his fifth term today. Branstad, a Republican, left office in January 1999 after 16 years of serving as governor. In October 2009, Branstad stepped down as president of Des Moines University, the state's largest medical school, and launched what he called a ""comeback"" bid for governor. Branstad is scheduled to take the oath of office at a ceremony around 10:15 a.m. Branstad told a group of reporters and editors last week that his wife, Chris, had urged him not to give a long and boring speech."
"The bride and groom in Canada spent their first night of marital bliss behind bars after their wedding party turned into a bar brawl. A wild fistfight between men and women erupted at Denizen Hall in downtown Edmonton just 15 minutes after the party arrived at the watering hole, according to witnesses.

At Kilmarnock Sheriff Court, the case was heard that animal welfare officers and police raided Barbara's home on High Street in Newmilns, East Ayrshire, on 12 November 2014, following a tip-off. Officers found two dogs with stab wounds and scars. The animals, named Kyra and Jackie, were being kept in cages in the kitchen and a bedroom."
"SANTA MARIA, Brazil – Beach balls the size of a group known for its pyrotechnic stage displays may have cost more than 230 people their lives at a nightclub in southern Brazil, according to a statement by the state police inspector leading the investigation into the deadly fire that occurred over the weekend. Inspector Marcelo Arigony told reporters at a press conference on Tuesday that the band members intentionally purchased fireworks meant for outdoor use because they cost only $1.25 apiece, compared to $35 for an indoor firework. ""The lit fireworks were meant for outdoor use only, and the people who lit them knew that,"" Arigony said."
"Indeed, by Sunday temperatures are expected to return to the 50s, and then possibly reach the upper 70s by January 10. But first, the National Weather Service is expecting mostly sunny skies and a high of 59 degrees on Tuesday. The front will move into Fort Worth by mid-day, but its effects are likely to only be felt in the overnight hours, leading to a rather chilly wake-up on Wednesday with temperatures hovering just above freezing. Wednesday's high is forecast to be 46 degrees with partly cloudy skies, followed by a low of 28 degrees."
"Numerous bills in the New Jersey State Assembly are of interest to truckers and other road users across the state. Repeat offenders who commit a drunk driving offense may soon face harsher penalties for their actions. Currently, New Jersey law limits punishment for affected offenders to a disorderly persons offense, typically carrying a $2,500 bail. The designation of a disorderly persons offense allows drivers accused of drunk driving to continue operating a vehicle until their court date. A bill before the Assembly would put a stop to this practice. Instead, A3057 would increase the penalty for a person convicted of driving under the influence two or more times within 60 days to a fourth-degree crime."
"The Lord of the Rings star Liv Tyler went for a stroll with her husband. The Hollywood star couldn't hide her smile as she watched the races on the second day of the festival in Cheltenham on March 15. Dressed all in black, the mother of three beamed brightly as she peered through binoculars to take in the racing. The stunning brunette wore a black silk dress that fell just above her ankles, with a butterfly motif on the cuffs and a belt around her waist. She added a wide-brimmed black hat and clutched a small black purse with a floral pattern on Ladies' Day at the festival."
"Why is a fiery Dutch journalist on the payroll of a former Alaska governor's political action committee? A Mother Jones investigation. In recent months, Sarah Palin's political action committee, SarahPAC, has paid thousands of dollars to a mysterious company that has gone to great lengths to conceal its ownership. The addresses associated with the firm lead to postal boxes. It has no website. There is no phone number. Even the California lawyer who registered the company didn't know who was behind it. But a Mother Jones investigation has found that the firm is managed by an unlikely foreign political figure."
"Carillon Beach - an organic lifestyle comes naturally to Leah and Andy Meyer, and their market and Sunrise Cafe is just an extension of that lifestyle. ""I love how everyone here is so friendly. The culture here is really interesting. And I love the beaches and the sunshine,"" Leah said Thursday, making pancakes from scratch in the cafe. She and Andy moved from the Northern California area to Seaside in February. The Meyers took to the Carillon Beach community, opening the cafe on March 21, and then organizing the Carillon Beach farmers' market this summer."
"The Bible teaches: ""Resist the devil, and he will flee from you"" (James 4:7). It also tells us to turn away from those who are controlled by various lusts (see 1 Tim. 3:5-6). Many great men of God have given in to fleshly temptations and potentially ruined their lives and ministries. One person said: ""It takes a lifetime to build integrity, and only a minute to lose it."" This is a true proverb! I believe that one of the most important reasons for leaders' downfall is that most of them never intentionally built psychological and emotional defense barriers."
"Former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke was sentenced on Friday to six years and nine months for the murder of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, more than four years after the shooting. Jason Van Dyke, a former Chicago police officer whose fatal shooting in 2014 of a black teenager, Laquan McDonald, rekindled heated national debates about police shootings, was sentenced on Friday to six years and nine months in prison. The veteran police officer was found guilty in October of second-degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery with a firearm for the October 2014 shooting. The shooting and its video sparked protests across Chicago and calls for Van Dyke to face serious prison time."
"Did Led Zeppelin steal from the 1960s band Spirit? And did ""The Voice"" steal from ""American Idol""? A recent lawsuit has the heirs of the composer of ""Taurus"" claiming that ""Stairway To Heaven"" infringes on copyright laws. Creative people have been borrowing from each other for centuries. But what constitutes real harm - business, artistic, or otherwise? How much of the original art has been transferred into the new work? That's always the murky part. Music copyright infringement lawsuits have been going on for over a century."
"A detailed process of updating, I hope it can be useful to you if you don't have such experience before. Let me take care of the back and unscrew the screws. Be careful, the keyboard is connected to the blue connector, gently pull it out! Take the back again and start unscrewing the screws in a row. Pull out the back bracket. Now start replacing the SSD. Alright. It fits perfectly into the slot. Assemble the screws to fit the SSD. Evaluate the SSD score, surprised me again, 7.8 points. As far as I know, the highest score is 7.9."
"Being optimistic about their first housing project in Cavite, Century Properties Group Inc. (CPG) and Mitsubishi Corp. signed an agreement on Wednesday to form a new joint venture that will bring to the real estate market affordable homes worth around 57 billion pesos over the next five years.

The first baseman of the Royal Family, Eric Hosmer, celebrates after Hunter Pence from the Giants team was put out, ending Game 3 of the World Series on Friday. Game 3 of the World Series turned into a team duel of pitchers on Friday, when eight relievers struck out nine for 7 1/3 scoreless innings for the Giants and the Royal Family."

"Jeremy Tucker is leaving the top marketing position at Nissan North America to ""pursue other opportunities,"" according to the automaker. A well-informed source claims that Tucker, who held the role of vice president of marketing communications and media at Nissan, was let go. However, Tucker describes it as a ""mutually agreed upon parting."" Sales at the automaker have been lackluster, and there has been some dealer discontent over the lack of national brand advertising, according to another source. The automaker's total U.S. sales for calendar year 2018 were down 6.2% compared to the previous year."

"Below is a text by Katrine Eggers Jensen, who is one of the founding editors of EuropeNow, a publication dedicated to political research, literature, and art at Columbia University. She previously held the position of Editor-in-Chief of the Columbia Journal and blog editor at Asymptote and Words Without Borders. If Poe were alive to read the works of Alejandra Pizarnik, it would have given him nightmares. Pizarnik is revered by writers such as Octavio Paz, Roberto Bolaño, and César Aira, the latter of whom called her the ""greatest and last"" poet, and she is one of the most important figures in 20th-century Argentine poetry."
"Albion striker Simon Cox has become a transfer target for Championship club Derby County. Rams boss Nigel Clough is keeping a close eye on the 23-year-old and will consider a loan move if he gets any encouragement from The Hawthorns. Sources in the East Midlands have confirmed today that the former Reading and Swindon player is on a list of forwards being tracked by Clough, who is keen to strengthen his attacking line. The Pride Park boss is also interested in highly-rated Gary Hooper from Scunthorpe, Billy Sharp from Sheffield United and James Vaughan from Everton, who he signed on loan last season."
"Ken Block creates amazing gymkhana videos. But the New South Wales police didn't want Ken Block to film this particular gymkhana video - the one you see right there - in Sydney. So the Hoonigan team went to New York instead, leaving Australia in the dust. Here's the video they shot - a video that could have featured the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Opera House and all of our city's most famous landmarks. Ken Block's Gymkhana Nine was filmed to coincide with the launch of Forza Horizon 3, which is set in Australia - so it made sense to film Gymkhana Nine in Australia."
"Rawalpindi: The senior students of Sadeeqa’s Learning System (SLS) Montessori & High School marked the Autism Awareness Day, says a press release. The Harley Street Senior Branch organised a special assembly in this regard, raising awareness among the students about Autism Spectrum Disorder, highlighting its causes, symptoms and ways to overcome it.

"ANSWER: I will reduce property taxes. We pay the highest property taxes in the US. I have already lowered property taxes at the local level. I will repeal the income tax hike. Families are struggling to make ends meet. My opponent just raised the income tax on them by 32%. I will preserve essential services for those who truly need them. We will end the corrupt one-party system of Madigan. ANSWER: All new and recent hires into 401k plans. Raise the age at which you can collect, except for police and fire. Change the annual cost of living increase from the current 3% to the Consumer Price Index (CPI)."
"The images we've published from Yemen may be just as disturbing as anything we've used before. That's why we've made the decision to publish them. Amal Hussein is a 7-year-old Yemeni girl with a haunting gaze, whose image appears at the beginning of our latest report from Yemen, a country engulfed in war and on the brink of catastrophic famine. Amal is just skin and bones, and her head is turned to the side, as if she can't bear to meet the gaze of those looking at her. Some readers may feel like looking away, too."
"Ballyhassig 4-17 Castlelyons 1-12: A polished second-half display enabled Ballyhassig to register a convincing victory over Castlelyons in the Cork Premier SHC quarter-final on Saturday evening. Inspired by Danny O'Callaghan and relying on five members of the Cork intermediate hurling squad, the Carrigdhoun side showcased many qualities that could facilitate a swift return to the top tier. While the forwards will garner attention, it was O'Callaghan's industry and the solidity of the Blues' half-back line that launched their second-half onslaught and reaped 2-11 (2-10 from play) on the scoreboard."
"US trade policy has become a top concern among financial directors, according to a quarterly CNBC survey. Approximately two-thirds of financial directors from North America and the Asia-Pacific region believe that US trade policy will have a negative impact on their company over the next six months. Seven of the 16 biggest declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index this year have been triggered by trade issues. US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin arrived on Capitol Hill on Thursday to answer questions about trade, tariffs, and NAFTA in the House Financial Services Committee. Mnuchin attempted to alleviate growing uncertainty in Congress as President Trump escalates the trade war with China."
"January 29, 2015: Follow the money. One reason the new peace talks are making progress is that the factions responsible for large swaths of the population are willing to compromise if it helps stop the accelerating decline in the standard of living across the country. Economic activity is shrinking, and shortages are increasing due to inter-factional fighting, and especially because two governments are claiming to run the entire country. Then there is all the Islamic terrorist activity. While most Libyans appreciated the help of the Islamic terrorist groups in overthrowing Gaddafi in 2011, since then these groups have become more of a threat than Gaddafi's secret police ever were."
"What exactly separates humans from machines? In fact, two things: creativity and empathy. Regardless of what is developed in the field of AI, it is precisely these two elements that can preserve the business of agency services and keep marketers busy for years to come. AI is a complement to what you do, it's designed to augment your capabilities. AI can create a layer of efficiency that companies would otherwise lack, and free them up to do work with increased impact. Agencies have succeeded in the past because they were creative."

"A police officer was kicked out of the force for his behaviour towards his partner during their relationship. The Northamptonshire police officer, who throttled his girlfriend in her bedroom and told her he would ""kill her"", has been sacked from the force. It took a year before the police officer Greg Mead's ex-partner went to the police to report her experience of being in a relationship with him in 2018 and early 2018. However, at a police misconduct hearing, the 28-year-old woman told panel members how Mr Mead lost his temper and became violent during their time together."

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington."
"Narendra Modi's selective challenge: to create jobs. Lots of them. The Indian government's failure to create millions of new jobs for its young population could be the reason for its election defeat. Aasihk Ahmed Iqbal had no reason to think he wouldn't be able to find a job. Although he came from a humble family, he studied at one of India's best schools, attended one of the country's best universities, and earned a Ph.D. in history from Oxford University after receiving a highly competitive scholarship. When he returned to India in 2017, he was optimistic about finding a job as an academic."

"The Russian data center market continues to grow. It is enough to look at the significant growth of commissioned facilities to find evidence of this. Consumers are no longer impressed by data centers with an area of several thousand square meters, containing 1000 or more racks - this has become a common thing. According to data provided by Datacenter Dynamics, over the past two years, the Russian data center market has outpaced India, China, and Brazil in terms of total investment. Similarly, based on recent construction data for the same period, Russia ranks second after Brazil among the BRICS countries in terms of total area."

This app has already been demonstrated to the Chinese government; the final version may be launched within the next six to nine months, depending on approval from Chinese officials. Google has a long history of transferring technology to its Chinese authoritarian partners. The Intercept report continues. The most obvious and frightening issue is that some malicious version of Dragonfly could be imposed on Google's and Android's domestic users."

"The main task of North Korea's junior minister for re-education is to refute everything that French intellectuals have ever said. One year, he made a special issue about Jean-Paul Sartre and began with Sartre's assertion that ""Three o'clock is always too early or too late for what you want to do."" Since it was a sleepy Friday, the junior minister would just make a quick call and rename his local football team to 4:25 Sports Club. This made Sartre look very foolish, because the club holds all its matches at 4:25 PM. In fact, every time they play, their fans chant ""Are you watching, Jean-Paul Sartre?"""
