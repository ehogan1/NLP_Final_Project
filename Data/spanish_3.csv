"New Girl is about to return, and our main characters are in very interesting places in their relationships. Cece and Schmidt have finally gotten married. Nick is in a pretty new relationship with Reagan, and Winston is practically with Aly. So, what exactly should you look forward to with interest. Here are six things that excite us about this season. 1. We're going to see more of Reagan. If you liked Megan Fox's addition to New Girl last season, then you should be happy that she's back."
"Singer-turned-actor Kim Hyun-joong is considering a return to the small screen, his agency said on Tuesday.

"As part of the LifeMedGreenRoof Project, the Directorate for Standards within the Malta Competition and Consumer Affairs Authority (MCCAA) has organized a second workshop to launch the public consultation on the Draft National Standard for Green Roofs. As part of the EU's 2020 Strategy, which aims to reduce energy requirements by a minimum of 20 percent by 2020, the Commission's 2011 Energy Efficiency Plan has identified that buildings have the greatest potential for energy savings. The plan focuses on mechanisms to reduce the energy requirements of existing buildings, particularly public buildings, and the role of dissemination projects in introducing energy efficiency measures."
"Voter fraud has been confirmed in several states, including Mississippi. Louisiana's top election official is warning residents about a possible scam to obtain sensitive information from potential voters after similar concerns in several other states. The scam involves a caller claiming to work for a voter registration assistance organization. The callers offer to register residents over the phone and in some cases send the voter an absentee ballot, said Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin. According to state law, residents cannot register to vote or request an absentee ballot over the phone."
"For small businesses that sell on credit, accounts receivable can make up a substantial part of the general ledger. During the annual audit, auditors will verify if their assertions regarding the accounts receivable balance can be proven. These assertions are known as assertions. The most common audit procedure related to accounts receivable is confirmation, in which the auditor will ask their clients to confirm their account balance. Knowing which assertions can be proven through confirmation can help you understand why your auditor requests multiple audit procedures on the same account. Accounts receivable confirmations primarily serve to prove the existence assertion."
"It's a good thing you're not Jim Furyk today. 1. The US team entered Sunday with a huge four-point lead in the Ryder Cup, and local fans were expecting to enjoy another dominant day. 2. Luke Donald won the first match of the day over Bubba Watson, to make the score 10-7. Still, the US has a big lead. Whatever. 3. Europe's Paul Lawrie swept the floor with Brandt Snedeker for another European point. 4. At least Keegan Bradley, the best player on the US team all weekend, was putting up a fight against Rory McIlroy."
"It happens: you press the snooze button once, twice, and then three times, so that when you've finally showered, dressed, and are ready to face the day, you're already running behind schedule. Many times, that makes you skip breakfast altogether. It turns out that your habit of having breakfast is a time-saving measure that shouldn't be skipped. First, eating a nutritious, high-protein, and balanced breakfast every morning is a proven way to give your brain a boost, improving concentration and performance. Additionally, breakfast is associated with better weight control, as it provides energy to your body and can reduce hunger later in the day."
"Dublin: Lawmakers voted overwhelmingly on Friday to support Ireland's first abortion bill, legalizing the practice in exceptional cases where doctors deem a woman's life to be at risk due to her pregnancy, as the predominantly Catholic country took its first legislative step away from a total ban. Exhausted lawmakers applauded the 127-31 Friday vote, while outside the parliament gates, pro-choice activists celebrated as they watched the result on their smartphones. It brought an end to an exhausting debate that kept lawmakers in discussion from Wednesday morning until 5 am on Thursday and, after a break to sleep, until midnight on Friday."
"The best Halloween costumes are inspired by the most memorable moments of the year, and 2016 has been nothing if not memorable. We've had the Summer Olympics and a U.S. presidential election, which dominate headlines (and Facebook timelines) every four years. Add in a visually stunning album from Beyoncé, the hysteria surrounding Pokémon Go, and the colorful and quotable madness of Suicide Squad, and 2016 is basically begging for a Halloween costume show. We've become experts in all things Halloween, producing over a billion page views of Halloween content. That's where we come in."
"Randy Pausch passed away last Friday.

"VOLGOGRAD/GELENDZHIK, Russia (Reuters) - Iceland will try not to collapse under the intense heat of Volgograd when they face Nigeria in only their second World Cup match on Friday, after impressively drawing with two-time champions Argentina over the weekend. World Cup debutants Iceland are dreaming of the knockout phase and are writing a new chapter in one of the most notable stories in international football in recent years. On their path is not only Nigeria, desperate for a win after losing their opening match 2-0 to Croatia, but also the challenge of the scorching temperatures in the southern Russian city."
"A pair of thieves from Metro Vancouver have been arrested and charged after they allegedly carried out a prolonged period of mail theft and identity theft. After the Coquitlam RCMP and Canadian postal inspectors worked together to investigate the thefts, investigators identified a prime suspect, made arrests, and used search warrants to acquire a large amount of evidence, according to a November 11 press release from the Coquitlam RCMP. Heine Hut, a 49-year-old Surrey man who is well-known to police, faces six charges, including mail theft, unlawful use of a mail key, and possession of stolen mail and a stolen credit card."
"First, we examine which major brands cost more to maintain during the first 10 years of a car's life. We grouped all the years of all models by brand to calculate their average cost per brand. In order to estimate the annual maintenance costs, we found the amount spent on each two oil changes (since oil changes are generally performed every six months). German imports head the list with a considerable advantage, which is not too surprising. Toyota and its two brands, Lexus and Scion, are among the cheapest, saving owners at least $10,000 in ten years compared to a BMW."
"AURORA, Ill. – A suburban teenager has died after a tragic accident in the parking lot of a high school.

"Veteran Congressman Jim Leach (R-IA) fell defeated in the 2006 massacre. I'm not a fan of ""moderate Republicans"", but it's worth saying that Leach was, in my estimation, clearly the best Republican in the House of Representatives. However, one can only be excited about his defeat. The fact that it happened only demonstrates how fundamentally rotten the GOP landscape had become in general. Leach was, in many ways, a person with genuinely decent instincts and some fundamentally sound ideas about how the United States should conduct itself in the world. However, in practice, he was useless."
"Donald Trump's tweets have long raised questions about whether they violate Twitter's rules that prohibit abusive behavior on the service. On Monday, after a Trump tweet threatened that North Korea might ""not be around much longer"", Twitter was forced to explain why the president wasn't kicked off the service. In a six-part tweet from Twitter's public policy account, the company said that Twitter takes into account ""newsworthiness"" and ""public interest"" when determining whether a user has violated its rules. These considerations have long been used internally when deciding the fate of a problematic user, Twitter said."
"No one can accurately predict when the stock markets will end their record bull run. But the best way for investors to face the next recession is to remain calm and stick to a well-thought-out plan. The Star asked Ashley Feinstein Gerstley, author of 30-Day Money Cleanse: Take Control of Your Finances, Manage Your Spending, and Reduce Financial Stress for Good, about why people have such a hard time managing their own finances, and how they can do it better. There are also other common expenses that people tend to overlook or incorrectly report by accident."
"After basically keeping pace during the first two months of the year, real estate sales in Summit County experienced a slump in March, leading to a notable downturn in the county's first-quarter figures, according to Slifer Smith & Frampton. The High Country real estate giant tracks a wide range of statistics associated with the local real estate market, and Summit saw a 12 percent decrease in both the number of real estate transactions and their combined value for the first three months of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017, according to the company's latest market report."

The council members will meet twice during the school year with State Superintendent, Dr. Tommy Bice."
"South Bend (IN) -- On Thursday morning, the Irish took to the practice field for the last time before Saturday's Blue-Gold game. One of the biggest questions the team faced entering spring ball still hasn't been answered: who will take charge of the linebacker position? Defensive coordinator Clark Lea said that fifth-year linebacker Asmar Bilal is the closest thing to a ""lock"" the unit has right now, but he seems okay with the uncertainty. He believes the position has made great strides over the last month and a half, but he's in no rush to have everything in place with Week 1 still months away."
"This month, Drake wrapped up his residency at London's O2 Arena. But he wasn't ready to fly back across the ocean and head home just yet. Instead, over the weekend, he joined Tiffany Calver, who hosts BBC 1Xtra's rap show and became her co-host for the day. While he was there, he talked about a wide range of topics. He talked about the early days of his career and even addressed rumors about him being a culture vulture because he appropriates British and Caribbean cultures. But the most interesting thing, well, for us Africans anyway, was his shoutout to Niniola."

"It's hard to reset the success and growing power of Amazon. Its market capitalization remains just below $1 trillion. Its growth rates have been astounding. By most estimates, Amazon now accounts for nearly 50% of all e-commerce revenue in the U.S., around 5% of all retail, and is significantly larger than its next 10 competitors combined. One study found that around 55% of all online product searches start on Amazon. This week, a report that Amazon is considering opening up to 3,000 of its cashierless Amazon Go convenience stores by 2021 drew a lot of attention, although they have only opened a fourth location a few days ago."
"NEW YORK — A lawyer who launched a tirade against Spanish-speaking workers at a New York City restaurant issued an apology on Tuesday. ""To the people I offended, I apologize. Seeing myself online opened my eyes — the way I expressed myself is unacceptable and that's not me. I see that my words and actions hurt people, and for that, I deeply apologize. While people should be able to express themselves freely, they should do so in a calm and respectful manner. What the video did not convey is the real me. I am not racist."
"Some applications aim to change the world, while others focus on bringing beauty to your portable devices. Beautiful Clock Widgets falls into the latter category. This small Android app does exactly what it says on the label, with a collection of clock widgets with the option of additional data, such as local weather and battery information. Some are great, others are fun... and a handful are frankly eccentric. It's worth mentioning here that some are only available through the Pro Version, which costs $1.26, or its equivalent in local currency."

"It is not unusual to read and hear complaints about the amount of insults and disqualifications that the two main parties utter, a phenomenon that seems to magnify during electoral campaigns. And yet, these two parties rarely actively seek to engage in real insults and disqualifications. And with that, I mean talking about trash in the literal sense. And yet, the issue of trash and waste in general is something that affects us all, touching on issues of public health, social cohesion, and tourism, among others."
"ZAMBOANGA CITY—Terror lurks among the residents of Pata Island in Sulu, and it does not come from extremists, but from politicians. The residents sought help from the government to prevent another attack on their island community, which, according to one of them, was triggered by the residents' refusal to support the incumbent mayor, Anton Burahan. ""We are powerless,"" said 60-year-old Bidin Jubail, a resident of Saimbangon, one of the villages on Pata Island. Jubail recalled an attack on the island on January 2, allegedly by Burahan's followers, who were armed with an M203 grenade launcher, and M-14 and M-16 rifles."
"German business confidence plummeted in October to its lowest level in more than two and a half years, the sixth consecutive decline that dispels any remaining doubt that Europe's largest economy has now been caught up in the euro zone debt crisis. The Munich-based Ifo think tank said on Wednesday that its business climate index, based on a monthly survey of around 7,000 companies, fell to 100.0 in October from 101.4 in September. ""The clouds over the German economy are darkening,"" said Ifo President Hans-Werner Sinn.

"The life of the mind is an enigma for poets and neuroscientists who dedicate themselves to tracing and labeling it, and, in my case, trying to find it. Thought itself is something that must be considered in the Irish tradition and, therefore, there are many concepts in the Irish language related to the mind, dreams, and imagination. I am only a student, so many of the nuances will be lost on me, but language is about conversation. I would love to hear native speakers offer more sophisticated thoughts on the vocabulary of Irish thought."
"According to analysts, the market is entering a consolidation phase after the recent boom. NEW DELHI: A below-normal monsoon forecast by private weather agency Skymet turned out to be a major hurdle for market indices on Wednesday, which gave up the day's gains after hitting record highs. According to Skymet, the 2019 monsoon is likely to be ""below normal"" at 93 percent of the long-period average (LPA) of 887 mm over four months from June to September. This caused the bulls to fall downwards, erasing previous gains, as the market ended in negative territory."

"LOS ANGELES – A proposal to grant subpoena power to the oversight commission that monitors the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department will go to a vote in March 2020, after not being adopted by the Board of Supervisors today.

Supervisor Sheila Kuehl said that more of the county's more than 10 million residents should be allowed to participate in the vote."

Egypt has been trying to negotiate a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, a Palestinian organization that has de facto control of Gaza, to avoid an escalation of violence near the Gaza border.

Michal Ya'akov, an Israeli military spokesperson, said that he saw a man acting suspiciously at the Hawara checkpoint on Monday, leading soldiers to believe he was armed with explosives."
"OTTAWA, March 20 (Reuters) - In a new blow to the beleaguered government of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a lawmaker left his ruling Liberal Party to sit as an independent on Wednesday after defending a former minister at the center of a political scandal. Trudeau has been on the defensive since February 7 over allegations that high-ranking officials working for him pressured former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to ensure that construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc would avoid a corruption trial. The political crisis threatens the government's chances of being re-elected in a vote scheduled for October this year."

This week, the East Bay Regional Park District issued a warning about rattlesnakes spotted on park trails now that the weather is warm. Jeff McKenzie was in the green belt near the Mountain."
"The Grant Bar and Grill is a lively spot with local musicians playing on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights and Sunday afternoons in the outdoor dining patio. If The Old Fish House could talk, just imagine the fascinating stories it would share about 100 years of residing on the Indian River estuary. It could tell us about the early days when entire families would sleep on their fishing boats. We would hear stories of river dawn, of husbands taking those same boats and joining the fishing fleet heading out to sea while families stayed behind with wives working hard at the fish house, processing fish."

Guideline 12 explicitly prohibited ""ads that promote or oppose any religion, religious practice or religious belief."" These new guidelines came after someone tried to purchase an ad with an image of Muhammad."

"The United States is carrying out a plan to push the Palestinians to the north of Sinai and transfer part of the West Bank to Israel. While President Donald Trump continues to boast and tweet in his own way through a chaotic presidency, the Middle East is boiling dangerously close to a boiling point. The wars in Yemen and Syria continue to wreak havoc, the conflict between Qatar and the so-called Quartet of Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt, and Bahrain remains without an apparent end, Iran continues to flex its military muscles, and both Iraq and Egypt are struggling to contain terrorist attacks."

"Maureen Wildes argues that it's time to uncover the true impact of the Vietnam War on the children of veterans. Like many other children of veterans, I am also a statistic. If this study had been carried out years ago, when it should have been done, perhaps I would have realized what was happening to me, not to mention my father. Hi, I'm the wife of a Vietnam veteran, I have 3 children. My first daughter is from my first marriage when I was 18 years old and the next 2 girls are from my second marriage in 1970."
"ALBANY — Governor Andrew Cuomo — who has two Twitter accounts with more than 863,000 followers — referred to the popular social media site as an ""elitist chalkboard"" on Tuesday and said he doesn't look at it.

Cuomo has two Twitter accounts, one with 853,000 followers and the other with 10,400.

"Less than two years ago, I was sitting at a South Atlantic League Single-A game between the Hagerstown Suns and visiting Greensboro Grasshoppers. Behind me were two Greensboro pitchers, Trevor Richards and Ben Meyer. They were following the game. As I discussed in this post, neither of the pitchers seemed destined for the Major Leagues. Richards had not been drafted in 2015 coming out of a small college, and thus had to begin his career with the Gateway Grizzlies of the Frontier League, an independent league. The Miami Marlins signed him in 2016 and he was pitching well for Greensboro."
"UNITED NATIONS, August 26 -- Amid a growing pace of media coverage forecasting US missile strikes in Syria, regardless of what the UN chemical weapons investigation team finds in the suburbs of Damascus, a question has arisen as to whether the strikes would take place with the UN team still in the country. Q: As for Syria, British and US officials have suggested that an investigation at this point may be futile because Damascus has had time to hide part of the evidence. What does the UN expect to find from this investigation? What actions would the UN be willing to take!"

"Without a doubt, the addiction drama ""Beautiful Boy"" – and not the horror movie ""Halloween"" – is the scariest movie opening in the multiplex this weekend. Starring Steve Carell (""Foxcatcher"") and Timothée Chalamet (""Call Me by Your Name""), the film is a chilling and disturbing look at a young man's descent into methamphetamine addiction (and heroin, pills, marijuana, etc.) and a devoted father's efforts to save him. It's a true and terrifying story so powerful that neither an uninspired director nor a clichéd script can diminish its impact."

"There has been a large amount of recent research that has shown that patients with dementia greatly benefit from participating in art therapy. While many may think that eating well and exercising are the keys to aging well, the International Journal of Psychogeriatrics has found that certain personality traits can have a huge impact on their life as they age, too. We all have busy lives, but if you have recently moved your loved one into an assisted living home or a memory care cottage, it is even more important to stay in touch with them. Nutrition is important in everyone's life, but especially in older adults."

"There's no stronger motivation to forget differences than pending ratings and contract negotiations. High above Midtown Manhattan, the favorite candidate in the Republican presidential race and the leading woman in prime-time news met to settle a score. Donald Trump and Megyn Kelly, who have spent the better part of the election cycle publicly fighting, privately seething, or mutually ignoring each other, met at Trump Tower on Monday, apparently ending the silence between them. ""Yes, the doormen seemed a little stunned when I walked in,"" Kelly said on her Fox News program Wednesday night."

"Magic — that's the best way to describe the championship win of Lytton High School's Rugby Academy. In only the second year of the academy, Lytton's under-15 girls, coached by Trish Hina, defeated Wanganui 66-0, Feilding 42-0, and Kapiti 49-0 on Day 1.

"PREBLE COUNTY — With two serious accidents involving youths occurring in Preble County in the last week, Preble County Sheriff Mike Simpson spoke about summer driving practices, as younger and less experienced drivers become more active during the summer. According to Simpson, during the summer, the roads tend to become more active and younger drivers tend to be on the road more because they are not in school. ""With kids out of school or kids back from college, there are many more young drivers on the roads going to and from events or to work now that they're not in school 6-7 hours a day,"" Simpson said."
"The relatives of the deceased listened bravely as the circumstances of the deaths were heard in detail. Heart-wrenching details about how the victims of the Clutha helicopter crash died were read out at today's fatal accident inquiry. It came in a joint minute of agreement, a legal mechanism meaning the Crown and the other 14 legal parties to the inquiry will not question the details.

"The State Correction Board in a special meeting convened this morning voted unanimously to appoint interim chief Kevin Murphy as the permanent head of the Department of Community Correction. There were no changes to his existing salary of $123,380. Murphy was put in charge after Governor Asa Hutchinson fired Sheila Sharp for questioning the agency's parole and probation staffing sufficiency. Murphy brings an irregular resume to his job. At one point, he had a deal being paid by a non-profit organization that worked on behalf of the agency's employees and was also receiving a pension from the Correction Department."
"Californians, of all people, should recognize what it means to expel people from their land. In the 1850s and 1860s, the state funded annual expeditions that emptied entire areas of their Native American presence. But this is not just a historical phenomenon: In the Gaza Strip, Israeli settlers and the Israeli government have been trying for decades to eradicate the small Palestinian village of Susiya. The village has existed near Hebron since at least the 19th century. In the 1980s, it was declared an archaeological site to allow settlers to move in and replace the old inhabitants."

An Iranian citizen has been arrested in Beirut on charges of human trafficking and forging legal documents, according to a report published in the Asharq al-Awsat newspaper on Friday."
"Every year, local and state authorities ensure that Bangaloreans are warned about safety before Diwali. However, like in previous years, more than 60 firecracker-related victims have already been reported in the city this year as well. Surprisingly, this year children between 4 and 14 years have suffered eye injuries as a result of ignoring fire safety precautions. The city has been lit up since Tuesday with the festive spirit, but city hospitals have received a total of 60 firecracker-related victims. Adding to this number, however, local clinics in several residential areas have been attending to patients who come in daily since yesterday."
"Bhubaneswar: Shashi Bhushan Behera, Finance and Excise Minister, has expressed hope that IOCL will participate in the Special Purpose Vehicles created for the development of PCPIR in Paradip and also in the Plastic Park in Paradip through equity participation.

"A cancer expert has found a way to kill tumors in two hours, using light. The technique involves a single injection with a chemical and then a flash of ultraviolet light. It was discovered that cancerous cells in laboratory mice self-destructed, with up to 95 percent eliminated in two hours. Professor Matthew Gdovin revealed that the cells, which he injected with the chemical compound nitrobenzaldehyde, became too acidic to survive. He said after patenting his ""photodynamic"" therapy: ""There are many different types of cancer. What they have in common is their susceptibility to this induced cell suicide."""
"Drones come in a wide variety of different shapes and sizes these days, but in general, most of them still fall into one of two categories. There are those of the multirotor variety (quadcopters, hexacopters, octocopters, etc.), and those of the winged variety. Both categories have their own advantages and disadvantages. Multirotor aircraft tend to be more stable and easier to fly, but also much slower than winged drones that focus on forward acceleration. In contrast, winged drones can fly faster and farther than their hovering counterparts, but are more difficult to pilot, as they cannot perform vertical takeoffs and landings."
"BASLE, Switzerland – Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche Holding AG said on Monday that it has received reports of 13 cases of H1N1 flu that have become resistant to Tamiflu, which it describes as a very low percentage. A good sign is that people with the resistant strain did not transmit the disease to other people, said David Reddy, leader of Roche's Tamiflu pandemic task force. And the resistant variety has been similar to the widespread version of the virus in the sense that it generally only produces mild symptoms. The 13 cases were scattered around the world in Europe, the United States, and Asia, said Reddy."
"Russian President Vladimir Putin described the downing of a Russian fighter jet by Turkey today (November 24) as a stab in the back administered by ""accomplices of terrorism"", and said the incident would have serious consequences. Speaking in the Russian city of Sochi, on the Black Sea, on Tuesday before a meeting with King Abdullah of Jordan, Putin said the downed plane had been attacked while it was inside Syria when it was 1 kilometer from the Turkish border and had fallen 4 kilometers inside Syria. This contradicts Turkey's claim that the aircraft had been warned multiple times that it was entering Turkish airspace before being shot down."
"Arsène Wenger believes the return to fitness of English striker Theo Walcott and the imminent recovery of German international Lukas Podolski means that Arsenal are not under additional pressure to buy another striker in January. The Gunners resume domestic action on Saturday with the intention of responding to the 1-0 defeat at Manchester United with a win over third-placed Southampton to remain at the top of the Barclays Premier League. Walcott is set to face his former club after spending two months on the sidelines with an abdominal problem that required surgery. Podolski, on the other hand, is on course to be available again by late December after being out since August 27 with a hamstring tendon injury."
"The New York Knicks are approaching the quarter mark of the calendar with a mediocre record of 9-9, as they seek to end their 43-year championship drought. Coach Jeff Hornacek and the Knicks will have the upper hand over opponents in December. In the 15 games they will play this month, only five of them will be against teams with winning records. They will host the Minnesota Timberwolves, who have a 5-13 record, on Friday. Joakim Noah, Derrick Rose, and Carmelo Anthony are likely the biggest names on the lineup, but they are not playing up to expectations. Anthony's team-leading scoring average of 22.2 points is slightly higher than last season's."
"The Hashemite Library remained as a beacon of knowledge and a destination for readers and intellectuals until 2000, when the number of readers began to decline, given the difficult economic situation in the Strip. In the 1950s, the Hashemite Library was commissioned to sell newspapers and books from prominent Egyptian publishing and distribution houses. It was also a space for writers and intellectuals to gather. However, the invasion of the Internet and the poverty of the inhabitants of the Gaza Strip have inhibited these activities. ""Due to the rise of the Internet and economic stagnation, we no longer receive books to distribute or sell."
"Google has had a long-standing tense relationship with China, with the search giant largely pulling out of the Chinese market after alleging that state-backed hackers had targeted the company's systems and employees. The upcoming book by chairman Eric Schmidt, ""The New Digital Age"", is not going to improve things, according to a description of the book by The Wall Street Journal, which has reviewed advance copies of the unpublished title. ""...in this world of total internet, China, the book says time and again, is a menacing and threatening superpower"", writes Tom Gara."
"Ray Trew has resigned as chairman of Notts County and announced that the League Two club is up for sale. Trew became owner and chairman in 2010, but said he took the decision after his family was subjected to ""mindless insults and abuse"" in recent days. Notts, who appointed Jamie Fullarton as manager in January, are 16th in League Two after being relegated last season. BBC Radio Nottingham reports that local businessman Alan Hardy is in talks to buy the club. ""It is with a heavy heart that I announce the end of my tenure,"" Trew wrote in an open letter to fans."
"Warning: There are graphic images in the video above. SODUS, N.Y. (WHEC) -- A new leadership team promised changes were being made, but complaints about care and conditions inside the Sodus Rehabilitation and Nursing Center continue to come to light. News10NBC has been investigating the facility and its record for over a year, and although administration was replaced last summer, families continue to find serious safety concerns inside. Joi Ann Mitchell-Kinley is the daughter of Bill Tanner's best friend, so when her father died, Bill took her under his wing."
"Do you want to end the war on whistleblowers? Review the Espionage Act. Over the past 100 years, the law has metastasized into a tool for government secrecy. The evolution of the Espionage Act has done much  to shape the freedom of political debate in modern U.S. What began as a vague statute granting President Woodrow Wilson the power to jail critics and censor the media during World War I has transformed into a powerful law regulating political discourse through the surveillance of secrets, not freedom of speech. Censorship did not end when the war ended. It evolved. Despite its name, the Espionage Act has always been a broad statute."
"Google is trying to save presentation audiences from having to listen to long, rambling questions with a new feature it added to its Slides software on Wednesday. Slides Q&A will allow audiences to send text questions via the web while listening to a presentation that uses Google's software. As the presenter speaks, she can see the questions and answer them, without having to wait for someone to speak into a microphone. The presenter view of Google Slides Q&A allows presenters to see what it is that people in their audience want to know. In addition to sending questions, audience members can also vote on which ones they want answered."
"Manfred Weber (41) is the newly elected president of the European People's Party (EPP), the largest political group represented in the European Parliament after the 2014 elections. He originates from the conservative Christian Social Union of Bavaria (CSU) in Germany. Weber spoke with Dario Sarmadi of EURACTIV Germany. David Cameron wants the UK to leave the EU if Jean-Claude Juncker becomes President of the European Commission. What would you say to the British Prime Minister? The UK belongs to the EU – and is, in itself, stronger within the community."
"When the Conservative Party leader, William Hague, pushed his way through the crowd of faithful at a Tuesday lunchtime rally and a presenter introduced him as ""the next prime minister of Britain"", even many of his supporters let out an involuntary laugh. The conservative London newspaper The Times had for the first time backed the Labour Party, supporting Prime Minister Tony Blair for a second term. The country's leading bookmaker, Ladbrokes, had already closed its book on Thursday's election and said it had begun paying out on a Labour victory."
"April 24, 2014, 10:30 a.m.
In some smart legacy news companies, there is growth in digital advertising and smart strategy. But most newspaper companies are finding that the important numbers are still going in the wrong direction. By Ken Doctor @kdoctor April 24, 2014, 10:30 a.m.
As we approach the mid-point of the 2010s, where do newspapers stand in the battle for the largest advertising sector in the United States, digital advertising? And how are all those paywalls working out for them? Two reports came into the public domain within a week of each other recently, and together, they help answer both questions."
"From the M1917 to the M1A2, American tanks have dominated the battlefield. The US Army and Marine Corps are about to celebrate a centennial: the 100th anniversary of the tank in American service. This animated GIF, created by the people at partcatalog.com, shows the evolution of the American tank: from the light tank M1917 to the M1A2 Abrams, and shows how the United States went from being a newcomer to the world of tanks to a world leader. The light tank M1917, for example, was simply a copy of the Renault FT-17. That type of copy engineering is an idea that would be unthinkable now."
"The most prominent name among all these groups is that of Bajrang Dal, whose activists burned alive an Australian missionary, Graham Staines, along with his two young sons in Orissa in 1999. This moving event is cited as an early example of saffron terror in India. The ugly face of Hindu terrorism has resurfaced again with the arrest of three people in Maharashtra for conspiring to carry out ""terrorist activities"" in various parts of the state. According to the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), 22 items have been recovered from the accused's house in Pune."
"Look for... Ron Brown from AAG Archaeology with the Netty door. Next, Netty's painting from Westoe. A recovered toilet from a historic building in South Tyneside now takes centre stage at one of the northeast's most popular visitor attractions. During a study of a Regency-era farm on Beach Road, South Shields, staff from northeast company AAG Archaeology found what is possibly the only toilet door to form part of a museum collection. It was eagle-eyed archaeologist Ron Brown who spotted what is believed to be the finest surviving example of a classic northeast netty door, emerging from the rubble of a demolished toilet."
"The best part of M. Night Shyamalan's 2017 horror movie Split - and one of the few things it did right - happened at the end. The brief and startling revelation of Bruce Willis reprising his character David Dunn from Unbreakable created a shared universe that Shyamalan was too eager to exploit. Unfortunately, there's a huge chasm between getting fans excited with a fleeting appearance and building a story around it. Glass, the third movie in what has become a trilogy, feels like a mishmash of half-baked ideas in an uneven pie."

"Sign the RootsAction petition to the nation's mayors and police chiefs to assert your support for the right to unrestricted peaceful protest. Occupy Wall Street protesters scored a major victory on Friday when Mayor Bloomberg and Brookfield Properties, the owners of New York City's Zuccotti Park, backed down from their demand that activists temporarily leave the park for a cleaning and then comply with new rules that prohibited sleeping bags, much of the equipment, and sleeping on the premises. Protesters in numerous other cities were not so lucky."

"ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) - Mike Minor was able to finish what he started, something the left-handed pitcher never had the opportunity to do for the Texas Rangers last season in his return to a rotation. The Angels have a record of 2-14 in their last 16 road games since last September - a period in which they have a record of 12-2 at home. ... The Rangers have hit home runs in all their 10 home games, the longest home run streak to start a season in Texas history. ... It was the second shutout of the season for Texas, both at home after having only one shutout win at home last season."

"Technology executives are debating the impact that automation technologies are having on their organizations. For many organizations and their workers, technology automation is both an opportunity and a threat. On one hand, the use of robotic process automation and other tools creates efficiencies by automating manual and repetitive tasks. On the other, it has the potential to make jobs redundant. Technology executives gathered at roundtable events in Sydney and Melbourne recently to discuss the impact that automation technologies are having on their organizations. A key theme raised during the discussion was the challenge of ensuring that governance policies and procedures continue to be followed as ""bots"" replace tasks performed by humans across the enterprise."

The two companies plan to create 39 jobs and invest $540,000 over the next five years while residing in tax-free zones at Binghamton University, announced Governor Andrew Cuomo's office on Monday. Baceapp Corp. and LightSpin Technologies Inc., which will be moving into Binghamton University's Engineering and Science Building, were two of the 17 companies unveiled on Monday as new participants in Start-Up NY, a program that offers tax-free status for 10 years in locations near or on university campuses."
"WASHINGTON, March 1 - After a record year of natural disasters that exceeded $1 billion, representatives of major insurance companies said today that costs to taxpayers and businesses due to extreme weather will continue to rise due to climate change. Insurers joined Senators Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) at a press conference to discuss the growing financial impact of global warming. Both Vermont and Rhode Island felt the impact of Tropical Storm Irene last August, one of the 14 record natural disasters in the United States the previous year, each causing more than $1 billion in damages."
"It was another quarter of rapid growth for the optical equipment manufacturer, but shares fell as investors were not inspired by the revenue outlook. Infinera (NASDAQ:INFN) reported its Q1 results on April 27 after the market close. Although the results slightly exceeded its own projections, traders sold shares in Thursday's trading, as the company projected that growth would slow down in the next quarter. By 3:40 p.m., shares had fallen nearly 24% from the previous close. Let's analyze the results to see how the company performed in the three areas I suggested investors keep an eye on."
"Edgar Wright has never made a bad film, not even a less than very good one, and therefore it makes sense that so far in his career, Wright has stayed away from direct sequels. However, that could possibly change with Baby Driver. When Shaun of the Dead was a huge success, instead of capitalizing on that with a zombie sequel, Wright, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost did a thematically connected trilogy - the Cornetto Trilogy - with the also excellent Hot Fuzz and The World's End."
"The TTP apparently cannot finance its operations due to a lack of money. ISLAMABAD: The Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) is facing a severe financial crisis since its late founder leader Baitullah Mehsud combined several scattered groups from the tribal region to form the most feared network of homegrown militants in 2007. ""The Taliban have been left seriously short of funds... they barely have any money now,"" said at least three associates of the group amidst an unexpected lull in their activities - suicide bombings and terrorist attacks in Pakistan and parts of Afghanistan - over the past few months."

"The General Accounting Office reported last month that the Small Business Administration needs to improve its planning for a new database system. The SBA had planned to implement the Electronic Loan Processing System (ELIPS) which is used to track government-backed loans for small businesses online last week, but the GAO said the agency has not shown that the project is a good investment. The SBA said it did not have time to complete the analysis required by the Clinger-Cohen Act because Congress required the system to be up and running by June 30. The US Army Materiel Command has issued guidance to improve teamwork between agencies and contractors."

In 1980, a group of non-commissioned officers (NCOs) overthrew the elected government despite intense resistance from a poorly armed police force, which only surrendered when the army forced them to submit. This led to the establishment of a de facto military dictatorship (although there was a nominal civilian president) in the country for the next seven years, headed by Sergeant Major (self-promoted to Lieutenant Colonel) Desi Delano Bouterse."

It also promises to narrate the rise to fame of the singer of I Will Always Love You."
"The first time I heard these verses was in a small church in a commercial space in Kiev, Ukraine. I remember it because it was the same Sunday morning that the tragic death of Princess Diana was reported. I had recently left my job on Wall Street and was living in Kiev with my mother after my father had passed away, and I was there because I wasn't having much luck finding my way forward. I remember the wooden panels on the walls of the room where I sat in the back, slightly embarrassed by the evangelical enthusiasm of my expatriate compatriots. But when I heard these verses, my wandering mind focused again."
"She grew up in a predominantly white and working-class housing development. ""We were the only black people, and I was called racist names on a regular basis,"" she recalls. ""In bed, I would pray and ask to be taught to teach children to be kind to me and to others."" ""This led me to have a 'rainbow of friends' — Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Rastafarians, and Christians. I always wanted to connect with the heart and soul of people, regardless of faith or culture."

"Guess what? The NBA is really a showbiz affair. Only superproducer David Stern isn't pulling all the strings behind the scenes (otherwise, New York would have somehow won the draft lottery). Instead, the league unfolds like an out-of-control, over-budget Hollywood production — driven by the egos of high-priced players, full of jaw-dropping plot twists, subject to endless rewrites. And think: we haven't even mentioned the Los Angeles Lakers yet. Unfortunately, the biggest news of the season has nothing to do with basketball."

If you want a luxury crossover with elegant design, a lower price, and an alternative to the usual import suspects, the 2015 Lincoln MKC is a compelling option.

"NASA will submerge a small robot into a volcano in Hawaii in order to map data and geographic features of its interior, such as fissures and volcanic vents. A similar robot is already exploring the volcano. ""We don't know exactly how volcanoes erupt. We have models, but they're all very, very simplified. This project aims to help make those models more realistic,"" said Carolyn Parcheta, a postdoctoral fellow based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, according to NASA. The robot, developed by NASA, can climb areas inaccessible to humans."
"Hearst Magazines will be busy in 2018, completing the acquisition of Rodale, buying some magazines in the Netherlands, and increasing the frequency of two of its newest titles. The Pioneer Woman magazine, a joint venture with blogger and Food Network star Ree Drummond, published two sold-out issues in 2017 and will double its frequency to four issues in 2018, according to Hearst Magazines president David Carey, who reported to employees in his annual year-in-review letter. That's a good change for Airbnb, which tried on its own in 2014 to launch a magazine called Pineapple, which only lasted one issue."

Adult manatees average around 10 feet long and weigh between 800 and 1,200 pounds. Manatees are among God's ugliest creatures in the ocean, and there are many strangely-looking sea creatures. Those are facts, well, the observation of ugliness is an opinion, but it's obvious enough to be a fact, which I learned from the Save the Manatee Club website."
"Arcade games are no longer just for kids. Some of the best online casinos on the web now offer arcade games that can be played for real money. But the newest and most exciting way to play arcade games for real money is on the go, using Apple's iPhone. Playing arcade games on iPhone is fun and easy. Players simply sign up at an iPhone casino, where they can find links to play a variety of iPhone casino games, including some arcade-style games. The genre of arcade casino games is perfect for the iPhone."
"The French woman who received the world's first partial face transplant showed off her new features to the public on Monday, saying in a strongly stuttering voice that she now looks like ""everyone else"" and hopes to resume a normal life. Isabelle Dinoire's speech was difficult to understand, but she explained how she had been disfigured by a dog bite last year, and thanked the donor's family for giving her new lips, chin, and nose. A thin circular scar was still visible where the facial tissue was grafted on in the 15-hour operation in Amiens on November 27."
"Did Donald Trump release Donald Trump's tax return! For a moment, it seemed like Rachel Maddow had a genuine scoop. And then, suddenly, it wasn't... Thanks to MSNBC, the suggestion that Trump ""paid no taxes for 18 years"" has been thoroughly discredited. Moreover, Trump appears to have paid a higher tax rate in 2005 than most political figures, and to have enjoyed considerable income, by the way. If the report was selectively edited, we have no way of knowing."
"MOUNT PLEASANT, Sanpete County — School officials are asking students who are not up to date on vaccinations to stay home for several weeks as Sanpete County deals with a mumps outbreak. There are two confirmed cases of mumps in Sanpete County, according to North Sanpete School District Superintendent Dr. Sam Ray. One of them is a district student, he said. Another potential case of mumps is pending as health officials await test results, Ray said. Ray did not say which school the student with mumps attends, but said North Sanpete School is ""involved"" in the outbreak."
"In times of scarcity, creative bakers resort to desperation pies: The Salt The vinegar pie and the green tomato pie don't usually top the list of America's favorite sweets. But in Depression-era America, these and other desperation pies that survive to this day showed the ingenuity of home cooks. Some desperation pies, like the green tomato pie, continue to enjoy niche popularity today. Imagine you're a resourceful farmer during the Great Depression. You want to prepare a dessert for your family, but traditional pie ingredients, such as cherries or pecans, are too expensive or unavailable."
"There is a Speed Graphic camera, which was once the standard equipment in newsrooms across the country. You may have seen them in movies from the 1930s and 40s that feature groups of photographers, with ""Press"" badges pinned to the ribbons of their fedora hats. Heavy, bulky, and requiring flashbulbs the size of light bulbs to shoot at night, a Speed Graphic was the first camera I used professionally, for my high school yearbook and the newspaper I worked for part-time while I was in high school and college. The one I have in my office used plate film: you took a picture, pulled out the film pack, and put in another."
"Anyone who has ever been frustrated with the task of recording video in low light should be ready to be amazed by Canon's strange and amazing new camera. It is a video camera that records high-definition color images in almost complete darkness. The 'multi-purpose' camera, simply called MH20F-SH, has a full-size image sensor with 2.26 megapixels. The reason for the low resolution is that each pixel is very large, exactly 19 micrometers. That is 7.5 times larger than, for example, the pixels found in a high-end digital SLR camera like the Canon 1Dx."
"Is our efficient Tax Office killing this country? I have never seen a story where the Reserve Bank has urged the government to provide tax cuts. But that is exactly what is happening now, which explains in part why our economy is slowing down. In fact, the implication of this historically unusual story is that the Tax Commissioner, Chris Jordan, and his team have been doing a great job fighting excessive claims of deductions, especially by businesses. Due to productivity delivered through computer technology, tax collection for the government is booming."
"A facilities manager wears many hats. It's not unusual for a facilities manager to lead a meeting, provide plumbing advice, present a renovation proposal, and ensure the floors are properly cleaned, all in one day. Facilities managers are responsible for the safety and health of all users of a building, as they consider how a facility operates. A strong background in management, technical skills, construction fundamentals, and technology is needed to be a successful facilities manager. A facilities manager provides supervision for the physical plant of a building or structural campus."
"A communications professor at Texas A&M University wanted to investigate the effects of changes in the newspaper industry on the politics of our nation, so he conducted a study, which has been published in the Journal of Communication. If you've noticed what seems to be a sudden increase in political polarization in recent years, you're not imagining things. And, as Johanna Dunaway, and some colleagues at Colorado State and Louisiana State universities found out, that polarization occurred during a period of steady decline in the number of local newspapers and journalists across the country."
"WASHINGTON -- An Iowa egg producer at the center of a national salmonella outbreak apologized to a congressional panel on Wednesday and admitted that his family business ""grew too fast before we stopped acting like we were small."" ""What I mean by that is that we were already big before we started adopting sophisticated procedures to make sure we were meeting all the government requirements,"" said egg producer Austin J. DeCoster, in his testimony before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee. He is the founder of an egg empire that has been linked for more than three decades to multiple deadly salmonella poisoning outbreaks in many states."
"A conservative candidate standing in local elections has been suspended from the party after failing to declare a pending drink-driving case at court, where he was subsequently convicted. Ben Wong, 48, owner of the South Dragon House take-away restaurant in Silver Street, put his name forward to stand in the Victoria ward election on May 2 under the Conservative party, but has been suspended since his conviction. Nominations to stand in the election closed on April 3, but he was tried at Taunton Magistrates' Court on March 21, something Somerset Conservatives were unaware of."
"Battfleck is officially history. Ben Affleck is no longer Bruce Wayne in The Batman. And he's passing the torch to a new actor, who has yet to be chosen. Warner Bros. recently announced the official release date of The Batman, with the DC solo adventure slated to arrive on June 25, 2021. Shortly after the news was announced, Ben Affleck joined social media to wish director Matt Reeves good luck in taking the masked crusader into the future. The tweet was later confirmed as Ben Affleck's farewell to the character."
"It's customary to leave a tip when dining out, but one particular tip added to an order of a milkshake and fries at a New Jersey diner is infuriating parents. ""My daughter would come to me and tell me that every time she and her friends went to the diner, they would charge them a tip,"" said Melissa Desch. ""And when I asked her why, she told me: 'Because they're kids'"". Desch said her daughter Isabella and other Colfax Schuyler Middle School students frequently go to the Wayne Hills Diner, just across the Hamburg Turnpike from school."
"DALLAS - Like many Americans, Martin Jacobson felt thrilled that the Navy SEALs had captured and killed Osama bin Laden. But the Dallas resident felt a deeper connection to the men who hunted down the mastermind behind the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Decades earlier, he was one of them. During World War II, Jacobson was part of elite groups that were predecessors to the SEALs. The secretive force is accustomed to staying out of the spotlight, but has returned to the headlines after the killing of bin Laden. ""I'm just proud of the SEALs,"" said Jacobson, 89."
"Northern Ireland was labeled today as the capital of racial hatred in Europe, in a report on racist violence in the province. Human rights activist Doreen Lawrence, mother of the murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence, was in Belfast for the launch of the report by the Northern Ireland Council for Ethnic Minorities (NICEM). The report identified institutionalized racism in the criminal justice system and questioned how it should be addressed. Racist violence has increased in Northern Ireland in recent years, not only against blacks and Asians, but almost against anyone considered a foreigner."
"Approximately 300 villagers from Kandal province, involved in land disputes with private companies, submitted petitions to embassies in Phnom Penh yesterday, before protesting in front of the provincial hall and seeking help from Prime Minister Hun Sen. The villagers told The Post that they wanted to put an end to the land disputes caused by companies that had ""grabbed their land"", and added that they ""would rather die"" than return home without getting a result. They said that authorities had ignored their pleas for help, while companies had used the judicial system to arrest villagers who complained about the acquisitions."
"The inclined press is a strength training exercise to develop the chest and front parts of the shoulders. The movement is performed in a position with the back up on an exercise bench adjusted at an angle. Then, dumbbells or a bar are grasped in an overhang position, and the elbows are extended and bent to lift the weight over the chest. Inclined chest press machines that simulate the movement in a fixed plane are another way to perform the movement. The inclined press is one of the several exercises that help create symmetry and strength in the muscles of the upper body."
"JURGEN KLOPP has revealed his delight at ending Pep Guardiola's 22-match unbeaten run with Manchester City, exclaiming live: ""What the hell was that?"". And the Liverpool manager also hit back at critics pointing to his leaky defence, adding: ""Inflate my boots!"". Klopp was on top of the world after masterminding a thrilling 4-3 win over the title favourites at Anfield this morning. A second-half onslaught saw Liverpool take a 4-1 lead before City scored two late goals to set up a nervy finish."
"No one asked me, but... if you pay dues to a neo-Nazi organization, you subscribe to racist publications, buy tickets to a Holocaust denial conference and have a Holocaust denial DVD in your video collection, then you're probably a neo-Nazi. That doesn't mean you're a neo-Nazi forever. You can have a change of heart and a change of mind, and clear your name. If you want people to believe you're no longer a neo-Nazi, you have a lot to prove. It takes a lot of work to shed the brown shirt."
"The first recognition of Brent Moloney's redemption from a post-match binge came mid-season when he was quietly reinstated into the club's leadership group. The second, much more public and significant than the first, came last night when he won Melbourne's best and fairest award. The 27-year-old Moloney took out the Keith 'Bluey' Truscott Trophy ahead of key defenders Jared Rivers and James Frawley at a function at the Crown Palladium. Two of Moloney's midfield teammates, Nathan Jones and Jack Trengove, were fourth and fifth respectively."
"The Weeknd will join Daft Punk for a performance at the Grammy Awards. LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Weeknd will join Daft Punk for a performance at the Grammy Awards. The collaboration between the singer and the electronic music duo is one of the numerous pairs announced on Tuesday. Anderson .Paak will take the stage with A Tribe Called Quest and Dave Grohl. Maren Morris is scheduled to perform with Alicia Keys. The Grammys had previously announced that Adele, John Legend, Bruno Mars, Metallica, Carrie Underwood, and Keith Urban would perform."
"DARTMOUTH — On June 14, Flag Day, students at James M. Quinn Elementary School in Dartmouth gathered outside to celebrate Flag Day. In itself, this is not unusual, but this year it took on a more personal meaning. The reason is that Dr. Carol Karafotis' cousin, Ted Cote, from New Bedford, is serving in Iraq. At the beginning of the year, around Veterans Day, Dr. Karafotis asked her students to send cards to Sergeant Ted Cote to cheer him up. The students responded and made cards that were then sent to Iraq."
"Will UBS name Bob McCann or Sallie Krawcheck to the top wealth management post? The former head of brokerage at Merrill Lynch, Bob McCann, and the former head of wealth management at Citigroup, Sallie Krawcheck, are being considered for the top post in UBS's wealth management unit. Investment News reported that two industry recruiters say both names are ""already circulating."" Previously, the Financial Times had reported that UBS's new chief executive, Oswald Grubel, had decided not to sell the company's wealth management business in the US, despite months of speculation that he might get rid of the business after the tax evasion allegations and subsequent scandal."
"If the U.S. presidential election were to be decided on social media, Barack Obama would be the clear winner this year over Republican challenger Mitt Romney. The Obama campaign has embraced social media, with the president maintaining a large lead in Facebook and Twitter followers, and the affiliated Democratic National Committee is using private social media tools to communicate with some campaign operatives. There is also evidence that the Obama campaign has taken advantage of social media analytics to gauge voter sentiment and track the popularity of campaign messages. Neither of the campaigns, contacted to discuss their social media strategies, returned messages."
"Should we take a pause just for a moment to define impact investing! Great! Now that they're gone, we can talk business. For over four years, I've been covering impact investing as a regular contributor to Forbes and have written hundreds of articles on the topic. The truth is: most impact investments are only open to high net worth individuals. This is a guide to impact investing for everyone else, the 98 percent of the population who don't meet the criteria to invest with the wealthy."
"Health authorities have issued another measles warning after a person traveled on public transport and visited two universities and a grocery store while infected. The alert is the fourth of its kind in recent weeks. The most recently infected person visited a number of public spaces between Sunday, January 27, and Wednesday, January 30. On January 30: on the train from Aubin Grove to Perth between 10:25 and 11:15 am, and from Canning Bridge to Mandurah between 2:20 and 3:15 pm.

"Wait for the sun today as high pressure sets in this weekend. After a cold start, temperatures will warm up to the upper 40s and lower 50s. A cold night ahead under mostly clear skies. Lows in the upper 20s and lower 30s. Winds will be out of the south tomorrow, meaning we will see some milder temperatures. Expect highs in the upper 50s. Some communities could reach the 60s. More clouds will build in though as the day wears on. It looks like clouds will clear out during the night with lows in the upper 30s and lower 40s."
"It looked like the scene after an earthquake. A sea of orange boxes covered the floors, with shoes piled up in every crevice, while stunned people stood in shock. But this was not a natural disaster. This was Black Friday at a Nike factory store in Seattle. Horrified shoppers at the Seattle Premium Outlets in Tulalip, Washington, shared photos and videos of the deplorable condition of the store after the holiday weekend. They show people carelessly trampling the boxes that protect Nike shoes as they walk through the outlet, grabbing and discarding sneakers mindlessly as they make their way."
"The 27th annual Southwest Iowa hot air balloon festival is underway this weekend in Creston. Balloon committee spokesperson Bill Fastenow claims that winds are the determining factor in deciding whether the balloons will fly or not and, of course, their destination. Fastenow says that this (Saturday) afternoon at 4:30, there will be a balloon pilots meeting, followed by a ""night glow"" at the Creston airport south of town, which he says is a beautiful sight to see. Creston Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Ellen Gerharz claims that at least 57 balloon pilots have signed up to participate in this weekend's events."
"CNET reporters are covering the launch of the highly publicized iPhone 4. Stay tuned for updates from New York City and San Francisco. It's finally here. The highly anticipated iPhone 4 will hit store shelves on Thursday at 7 a.m. local time in each time zone where it's available. CNET has teams of reporters covering the launch in New York City and San Francisco. Marguerite Reardon and Caroline McCarthy will lead the coverage in New York, while Erica Ogg, Josh Lowensohn, and James Martin will be keeping an eye on what's happening out west."
"The unemployment rate in Stark County in August fell to 6.8 percent, the lowest level since September 2008. For the first time since 2008, Stark County's unemployment rate dropped below 7 percent, and a variety of factors likely contributed to the decrease. A prime suspect is the influx of businesses coming into the area due to the oil and natural gas exploration in the Utica Shale formation. Oil exploration companies have set up operations, followed by engineering and construction companies providing various services. Manufacturing has also experienced growth due to the growing local and national demand for steel and drilling equipment."
"A horror movie icon will visit one of Gaston County's haunted attractions on Wednesday and Thursday. The actor Derek Mears, who has appeared in ""Friday the 13th (2009)"", ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"", ""Predators"", and ""Men in Black II"", will greet thrill-seekers at The Haunted Mill in Belmont. Kevin Blanchfield, the mill's owner, said he tries to offer something new and exciting every year at the attraction. He hopes the appearance of ""Friday the 13th"" character Jason Voorhees will boost attendance during weeknights. The mill usually sees around 200 to 300 people on weeknights near Halloween."
"WASHINGTON (News Alliance) - The price of gold remained stable on Thursday after the Fed's latest economic report said that companies across the US have become less optimistic in recent months. Spot gold rose 0.2% to $1,294.11 an ounce, while US gold futures remained virtually unchanged at $1,293.75 an ounce. As economic hurdles mount, the Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates stable at least until June. The dollar took a breather today after recent gains, while the pound sterling stabilized after British Prime Minister Theresa May won a confidence vote in parliament and urged lawmakers to break the deadlock in a Brexit divorce agreement."
"President Jacob Zuma believes the public protector's report on state capture was a political tool intended to be used to deal with certain individuals. In an exclusive interview with ANN7 on Monday night, Zuma spoke about former public protector Thuli Madonsela's state capture report, in which she recommended that Zuma establish a commission of inquiry into state capture and that Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng choose the judge to preside over it. The report investigated whether Zuma's friends, the controversial Gupta family, had undue influence over the executive."
"Why we love it: few things are as elegant as a good night's sleep. After all, a night of rest can leave you looking fresh and feeling refreshed in the morning. Perhaps one of the most important factors that contributes to capturing quality Zs is a good mattress. The new mattress, which is available in sizes ranging from twin to California king, is made with five layers of ""premium"" foam, including one inch of ""flo"" foam, 1.5 inches of latex foam, 1.5 inches of viscoelastic memory foam, 1.5 inches of high-resistance foam with gel support pillows, and more."
"Jenna Barker of Seton Catholic set a sectional record by winning the 1,600-meter run in 5 minutes, 13.04 seconds, and also won the 800, while several area athletes qualified for regional during the IHSAA girls' track sectional on Tuesday at Connersville High School. Other individual sectional champions included Riley Austin of Richmond in the 200 and long jump, Nakala Bennett of Richmond in the 100, Hanna Stamm of Seton Catholic in the 3,200, and Austin, Lindsey Griffin, Payton Vanmiddlesworth, and Riley Wetzel of Richmond in the 400 relay."
"When the theme of the convention seemed to have been ""Drill, baby, drill"", which is an energy policy in the same way that ""Taxes, baby, taxes"" is a fiscal policy (i.e. it's not), the slogans are obviously all that's left to the party. Even if you think that increasing oil exploration and supply through more offshore drilling makes sense, you can't take these people seriously. Unfortunately, you can. This, by the way, was the moment when I fully realized the convention."
"The new chairman of the National Children's Hospital board has said it would be ""a bad deal"" for the State to allow the hospital's main contractor to withdraw from its role. The newly appointed chairman of the board, Fred Barry, who is appearing before the Oireachtas Health Committee this morning, also said there was an ""underestimation"" from a very early stage in relation to what the project would cost, which led to a hike in the bill to €1.73 billion, from the estimated cost of €800 million in 2014."
"Bob Cannard loads compost that originally came from San Francisco's food scraps at Green String Farms on the outskirts of Petaluma, Calif., on Friday, March 6, 2009. As a parent and someone who has worked with parents for many years, I was shocked by the front-page report on the heartbreaking death of a baby in El Cerrito (""Baby's death in car is a tragic lesson for all parents,"" June 10). The premise that parents can ""easily forget that their children are in the back seat"" is, sadly, all too true."
"Summary: Southeast Toyota Distributors, LLC (SET) is recalling certain model year 2016 Toyota Yaris, RAV4, Land Cruiser and 4Runner vehicles, and Scion FR-S, iM, and TC vehicles manufactured from January 28, 2016, to March 14, 2016. The load carrying capacity modification label may not reflect the correct added weight of the installed accessories. As a result, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard number 110, ""Tire Selection and Rims for Motor Vehicles."" Consequence: An incorrect label may result in the vehicle being overloaded, increasing the risk of a crash."
"An American Civil Liberties Union lawyer today asked a federal appeals court in San Francisco to block a California law that requires police to collect a DNA sample from anyone arrested on suspicion of a serious crime. The law is part of a 2004 voter initiative that gradually expanded the categories of people in the criminal justice system from whom DNA is collected through cheek swabs. The four plaintiffs are challenging a provision that took effect in 2009 and requires DNA sampling of all those arrested for serious crimes, regardless of whether they are charged with or convicted of a crime."
"Really? Was it that complex? The Green Bay Press-Gazette reports that authorities say they are two to three weeks away from completing an investigation into an alleged sexual assault involving Packers cornerback Brandon Underwood. Underwood has been accused by two Milwaukee women of assaulting them in Lake Delton, Wis., a resort area, after a charity event. The alleged incident occurred on June 5 and days after the incident, police officials said they doubted charges would be filed as a result of the incident. One of the main obstacles! The stories told by the women allegedly changed, initially implicating several Packers players and then only Underwood."
"A new logo will soon be developed to help identify how the community feels about the Seminole County school system, using at least one of the four winning entries in the County Logo Contest. School board members said they wanted a new logo because the system's current emblem, that of a school crossing sign, does not reflect the district's academic achievements. The competition was divided into four age groups: 10 years or younger as the elementary group, 11 to 14 years in the junior group, 15 to 18 years in the senior group, and 19 years or older in the adult group."
"LOS ANGELES (AP) - Kings forward Anze Kopitar will undergo surgery on Wednesday to repair the broken ligaments in his severely sprained right ankle. A magnetic resonance imaging exam on Monday confirmed that the Kings' top scorer will require corrective surgery that will keep him out of the game indefinitely. Kopitar injured his ankle when he fell awkwardly during the Kings' victory over Colorado last Saturday. Coach Terry Murray initially said the Slovenian All-Star had broken his ankle and would be out at least six weeks, but the Kings eventually determined the injury was a high-grade ankle sprain. Kopitar leads the Kings with 25 goals and 43 assists."
"Two people have been injured in a crash on State Highway 2 near Whakamaramara. What was initially reported as a three-car crash yesterday, police now believe were two separate crashes in almost the same spot near Apata Station Rd. A St John Ambulance spokesperson said two people were taken from the crash scene to Tauranga Hospital, one in a serious condition and the other in a moderate condition. Police received the first call to the area around 1:10 pm. ""Two crashes occurred in a short space of time in the same area. It appears a utility vehicle went off the road, and after that a collision occurred between a car and a truck."
"Richard Randolph Lamb, a resident of Dunsmuir, passed away on September 17, 2009, at Mercy Medical Center in Mount Shasta. Richard was born in Fairview, Montana. He moved to Siskiyou County from Oregon in 1919. Richard was a veteran of the United States Navy, serving in the Pacific Fleet during World War II. He worked as a railroad engineer for Southern Pacific Railroad for 34 years. Richard was a member of the Dunsmuir Veterans of Foreign Wars. His hobbies included bowling, cars, music, traveling, and love for his family."
"The Korea Shipbuilders' Association has released numbers that confirm the expectations of many analysts: the number of shipyards in active operation around the world has decreased by more than 40 percent compared to what it was seven years ago. The study defined an active shipyard as a facility with at least one ship on its order book. Active Chinese shipyards decreased from 380 to 140 and Japanese shipyards went from 70 to 60 in the same period, according to the association. Even worse, the world's largest shipyards – DSME, Hyundai Heavy, and Samsung Heavy – may have empty space and unused capacity at some point next year."
"""Interaction of Color"", the 1963 seminal book by Josef Albers — the German-born artist and educator who taught at the Bauhaus, Black Mountain College, and Yale University throughout his distinguished career — is not just for aspiring artists. Its hypnotic illustrations are a revelation for anyone interested in color theory and human perception. On Thursday, to commemorate the book's 50th anniversary, Yale University Press, the publisher of the original edition, will offer a new way to interact with Albers' lessons by launching the ""Interaction of Color"" app for iPad."
"MELBOURNE, Australia - The defending champion, Victoria Azarenka, struggled to contain the injured American Jamie Hampton 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 on Saturday before advancing to the fourth round of the Australian Open. Hampton, who required a medical timeout due to a problem in her lower back before serving in the second set and twisted in pain, frequently on the verge of tears, throughout the third set, still managed to hit 41 winners to keep top-ranked Azarenka under pressure. Azarenka appeared frustrated at times, but overcame an early break and defended a triple break point in the seventh game of the decisive set before winning the match in 2 hours, 9 minutes."
"Suzuki discovered inadequate testing in 6,401 units out of a total of 12,819 since 2012. In a major blow to the Japanese automaker, Suzuki Motor announced that the company used inadequate fuel economy and emissions testing on its vehicles in Japan. According to Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport, Suzuki, along with Mazda and Toyota, admitted to cheating on emissions tests and submitted a report on sample vehicles manufactured during the quality assurance process. Additionally, it was found that the samples had been subjected to testing under inadequate driving conditions. However, the company is not considering a product recall at this time."
"Brands should resist the temptation to tackle a contentious issue in the Super Bowl as a way to stand out, said Aimee Drolet, professor of marketing and behavioral decision-making at the University of California, Los Angeles' Anderson School of Management. ""It's generally not the best place to do it because the audience is so broad, so you're inevitably going to offend half the people,"" she said. In other matters, U.C. officials announced that the 10-campus system had set a new fundraising record in 2017-18, raising more than $2.7 billion."
"Margaret O'Brien, 69, moved from Canada to Wolverhampton in 1971, married, had three children and worked for the local council for over 25 years as a canteen worker, meals on wheels driver, school dinner lady and cleaner. A back injury a few years ago meant she had to give up her job, which led to her claiming benefits for the first time. In 2015, she was told her disability payments had been suspended because she was an illegal immigrant. The letter informed her ""of our intention to remove you from the UK to your country of nationality if you do not leave voluntarily""."
"Let's stop trying to put a label on it and just be happy. Alright, I'm going to say this so everyone can stop speculating about whether Taylor Swift and Calvin Harris are a couple: they're just dating. You must have heard Taylor's song from 1989 ""I Know Places"". It's a song about developing a relationship while the paparazzi follow their every move. ""Something happens when everyone finds out / Seeing vultures circling, dark clouds / Love is a fragile little flame that can be extinguished,"" she sings. Just hang in there, HarriSwift."
"PARIS (Reuters) - Longchamp, one of France's leading handbag manufacturers, plans to increase its presence in China, according to its CEO, in stark contrast to the reduction of its rivals and despite the economic slowdown and shift in consumer culture there. Many of the top luxury brands, such as Kering's (PRTP.PA) Gucci and LVMH's (LVMH.PA) Louis Vuitton, have reduced the opening of new stores in China as part of campaigns to preserve their exclusive image. ""We are far from having fully exploited China,"" said Jean Cassegrain, CEO of the privately-owned group, in an interview with Reuters."
"The annual gathering of Kelly's band is usually a festive affair. The meeting, an idea of New York Post media columnist Keith J. Kelly, has been held on St. Patrick's Day for the past three years at Langan's pub on 47th Street. The guests: media types and others celebrating their shared Kelly surname and innate Irishness, with corned beef and cabbage and a few pints of Guinness. But the mood shifted when Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly arrived. Wearing a green tie, he tried to keep things light: ""Kellys are fun people,"" he declared."
"NEW YORK — Just before noon on Wednesday, Australian Ambassador and President of the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty Conference, Peter Woolcott, launched his final version of the global arms control agreement. In releasing the document, Woolcott informed delegates that they have 24 hours to consult with their respective governments and then present themselves the next day for a final vote. For many reasons, the United States delegation must opt for the latter. The following are some sections of the proposed agreement, each of which would require the federal government to infringe upon the constitutional right of Americans to keep and bear arms, as protected by the Second Amendment."
"The sixth race of the Charlevoix Yacht Club summer series was sailed on August 8 with light and variable winds. Twenty-two boats finished the race, which consisted of a shortened course of six windward and leeward legs. Affinity was the fastest boat overall, and only 26 seconds of corrected time separated the top three boats in the Spinnaker A fleet this week. Two more races and a discard will determine the summer series totals. The race results were provided by Mike Miller and Keith Attee, committee chairmen. Jib and Main Fleet: 1 - Sonnett (Lepmann); 2 - Exitus (Pung)."
"A search for 'toxic mold' will yield hundreds of warnings and frightening studies, but few are based on science and many are motivated by profit. Recently, one of my patients was hospitalized for liver failure due to alcohol. His history of liver disease was well-documented, but he vehemently denied that anyone had warned him that he should avoid alcohol. An initial admission of ""a few drinks"" turned into much more with a little investigation by different medical providers. Although his liver was in a state of significant shock, he was stable and fortunate to still have most of his liver function intact."
"It's easy to lose democratic mechanisms but hard to recover them, says the incoming general secretary of the World Lutheran Federation. Speaking at St Paul's Cathedral in London, Bishop Katharine Jefferts Schori challenged Christians to take action against the world's injustices.

The Maltings, which connects the bus parking lot with the city center, had been closed to the public and protected by cordons and security tents since former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found collapsed on one of its park benches after being poisoned. The market traders were relocated behind the commercial precinct by Wiltshire County Council while the decontamination operation was carried out."
"It may not be the household name that devices like Roku, Chromecast or Fire TV are, but Nvidia's Shield TV remains a capable streaming player, so much so that it earned a spot on our list of the best streaming players you can buy.

At least, not in the way most people understand it. As a marketing director for an industry provider, my daily job is to educate real estate agents. However, when I come to Inman Connect, I can learn from the agents."

"By arresting Haniyeh, Israel sent a message that the smuggling of Palestinian money is coming to an end. It is an open secret that Hamas has been smuggling millions of dollars into Gaza through the Rafah crossing since the international community cut off financial aid to the Palestinian Authority a few months ago, after Hamas' rise to power. However, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's decision on Thursday to close the Rafah crossing to prevent Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh from bringing $35 million into Gaza was the first time Israel actively intervened to stop the flow of money."

""I have to confess, at the time I was pretty angry,"" he said about the strong reaction against him from the White House and the people of the Gulf of Mexico. ""I hadn't seen my son in three months."
"It's safe to say that Cleveland Browns cornerback and former ASU student Damarious Randall didn't expect a response like this. After the Warriors advanced to the NBA Finals on Monday night to set up a rematch with the Cleveland Cavaliers, Randall made a guarantee on Twitter: ""If the Cleveland Cavaliers win the 2018 NBA finals I'll buy everyone who retweet's this a jersey..."" 
Well, as of Wednesday afternoon, Randall's tweet has been retweeted over 800,000 times. That's a lot of jerseys, more than Randall could probably afford to give away."

A rare seal from the time of the Crusades has been found in the Kiryat Yovel neighborhood in Jerusalem. The lead seal, which dates back about 800 years, bears the likeness of Saint Sabas, one of the most important figures active in Jerusalem during the Byzantine period, about 1,500 years ago.

"When I went to meet Bono in the bar of his hotel, I saw Richard Gere sitting at a table with a beautiful woman in a small fur coat and a leather cap. Bono, on the other hand, had retreated to a quiet room in the back, where he was keeping company with a stout middle-aged white man in a suit and tie.

"Dundee has long been a city of great character, great wealth and extreme poverty. If the new V&A can give it a transformative boost, it will be worth every penny. I declare an interest. I attended the University of Dundee in its last year as a college of St Andrews and, like many to whom life has assigned a season in the city, I have retained a great affection for the place and its people. Not everyone grew up to love it. In those days, ""clearing"" sent hordes of last-minute placements to what they fondly anticipated as the cloistered life of Queen's College, St Andrews."

The defensive aspect is expected to change with Steve Spagnuolo as defensive coordinator instead of Bob Sutton, but pass-rushers are always highly valued and general manager Brett Veach didn't seem to be preparing to say goodbye to Ford."

The Dubai index was the sole gainer of the session, rising slightly thanks to gains in banking stocks, while most of the Gulf's main bourses fell due to weak global sentiment and low oil prices. Oil prices fell to their lowest level in over a year on Monday, as fears of an economic slowdown weighed on the market."
"A popular fish and chips shop that closed in the summer is set to reopen under new management - with a modern twist.

"A new survey reveals that more Americans would choose the Internet as their sole news source than television, radio, and newspapers combined, and Internet reports are considered far more reliable than other media. It also shows that only 1 in 200 people surveyed believe that newspapers will be a dominant source of information in 2014.

"How the internet has come to the world's roads. The early web: the UNIX command was beautiful if you knew what to do. This month, the World Wide Web turned 20, and its birthday was celebrated around the world. It was a pleasant change compared to when the medium, which was once a new frontier of hope, had been viewed with suspicion since the Cambridge Analytica scandal occurred. We had spent years outraged by the possibility that our choice of washing machines and underwear was being conditioned by the web's smart advertising, and in 2018, we learned that even voter choice was open to manipulation."
"The crowd's response to the bombs at the finish line was, I think, exemplary. Of course, many people fled the explosions, and with reason. But a notable number ran, as they say, towards the sound of the guns, despite the fact that when two bombs explode, one might expect more. Many of these were professionals. The finish line of a marathon is a lucky place to put a bomb, since it's where the medical personnel, police, ambulances, etc. are stationed. Some soldiers were in the area by chance. But others were not professionals."

This is according to researchers at 24/7 Wall Street, who created an index using the proportion of potentially hazardous bridges, roads, or dams to identify the states with the worst infrastructure of all."
"Sanford already has private attorneys. Garber said he was hired to protect the institution of the governor's office and to help lawmakers realize the gravity of their deliberations. ""The eyes of the world are on South Carolina,"" Garber said Tuesday, adding that lawmakers' decision on whether to impeach Sanford will have repercussions for future governors of South Carolina and for the state. Garber said Sanford's disappearance for five days in June to secretly visit his mistress in Argentina does not meet the high standard required for impeachment. The state Constitution states that serious crimes or other grave acts of misconduct are the only reasons for impeachment."

"The most likely source was highlighted for the Boston Red Sox on Sunday. David Ortiz, who has never backed down from a big moment, hit a three-run homer off Joba Chamberlain in the ninth inning to give the Red Sox a 5-3 win over the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park. The win ended Boston's five-game losing streak and stopped the club's string of seven consecutive series sweeps. Ortiz's feats obviously put the Red Sox on top. But there was a lot more to Sunday's win, so let's take a look at some notes from the nationally televised meeting."

"Everyone knows where they were and what they were doing when this nightmare called 9/11 occurred. Chuck was getting ready to go to work and I was on the computer watching FOX when those horrible images appeared. I had the TV on mute, so I only saw flames coming out of one of the Towers in New York. I turned on the sound and the words were unintelligible. For some reason, even before knowing why and what, tears had begun to well up in my eyes. It's funny how your gut instincts take over before your mind registers what's happening."

This Colombian acrobatic troupe, a dozen young performers presenting the world premiere of their latest show, is one of the main attractions of the Blackpool Showzam Festival, now firmly established in February, with performances from all over the world.

"Twitter used to be a great place to share your succinct thoughts. Now, Al-Shabab, Al-Qaida's visceral Somali allies, are using it as a vehicle for propaganda. Al-Shabab began tweeting in English on Wednesday using the username @HSMPress. (HSM is the English acronym for Al-Shabab's larger name, Harakat al-Shabab al-Mujahideen). Jack Dorsey and his company have yet to verify the account, but it sounds pretty authentic: a tweet on Wednesday said the terrorists ""welcomed"" the surrender of seven Somali government soldiers after they ""proclaimed repentance for apostasy""."

"DENVER -- During the summer of 2002, Colorado state officials were dealing with the 138,000-acre Hayman fire while trying to convey the message to potential tourists that the state was still open for business. That comment virtually short-circuited the state's summer vacation season. This time, tourism and travel officials want potential visitors to know that less than one percent of public lands are affected by the wildfires. When Owens made his comments, Colorado had received 24 million visitors who spent around $7 billion annually. Denver had received 10 million visitors who spent around $2.3 billion. In 2011, Colorado received 58 million visitors who spent $10.7 billion."

BRUSH to the state of Minnesota for using private receipts to enforce weight restrictions after the fact."

He spent two seasons with Pittsburgh and one with Jacksonville, playing in 45 games, starting 17, and intercepting three passes. But Battles lost his love for the game last year and retired just two weeks after starting training camp with the Buffalo Bills."
"When George Orwell wrote ""1984"", he included a vision of the future in which people would converse in a language called Newspeak. Orwell described Newspeak as ""the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year"". Orwell's idea with Newspeak was to have a world where all nuances of meaning were eliminated from language, which reinforced the total dominance of the State. Calling something by a name when it is exactly the opposite could also be an example of Orwellian Newspeak, such as calling a bill full of spending on liberal social programs an economic stimulus plan."

Police say the woman was walking along Barncroft Drive, Lindfield, between 4:45 pm and 5:30 pm yesterday when she was grabbed by a white man with a beard in his late 40s or early 50s.

"If this was supposed to be a magic wand game for the Flyers, they came up a little short. After a 12-1-1 start since January 12, the Flyers skated straight into a wall called the Tampa Bay Lightning on Tuesday night and it was a reality check. The team with the best record (46-11-4) in the NHL handled the Flyers with ease on their way to a 5-2 win at the Wells Fargo Center, sweeping the season series. With Pittsburgh winning in New Jersey, the Flyers fell eight points behind a playoff spot once again."
"The second part of Naomi Klein's report on the events that triggered a new kind of politics in Argentina. Until very recently, Argentina followed a policy of official amnesia regarding the crimes of the Dirty War. Of course, non-governmental human rights organizations continued to publish numerous condemnatory reports, the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo continued to march, and the children of disappeared parents continued to occasionally appear outside the homes of former military leaders to throw red paint. But prior to the Argentinazo, most middle-class Argentines considered such actions to be morbid rituals of a bygone era."

"South Dade will seek to win its sixth consecutive Class 3A state title this weekend.

Gibson speaks about the Utah Inland Port Authority bill he sponsored as Utah lawmakers gather at the State Capitol in Salt Lake City for a special session on Wednesday, July 18, 2018.

"The Mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio, won't be visiting Israel until August, but that doesn't mean he can't join and dance with Hasidic Jews beforehand. The mayor may not have known all the words, but as the video below shows, he certainly got into the spirit of ""Hevenu Shalom Aleichem"" and ""Am Yisrael Chai"" at Sunday's ""Celebrate Israel"" parade in New York. He's not the first politician to dance with Chabad, you can see the Governor of Texas."
"Members of the Muslim community in Lubbock reacted with surprise and dismay to the news of the February 23 arrest of Lubbock resident and Saudi native, Khalid Ali-M Aldawsari, accused of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction.

"Gaza is the world's largest prison. Almost two million Palestinians are locked up there by Israel's military blockade. Last year, racist Israel killed over 2,000 Palestinians in Gaza, including 547 children. The Pentagon provided more bombs when the Zionist state ran out of ammunition. Baltimore, similar to Palestine, is under racist military occupation. The Baltimore police force — the sixth largest in the 26th largest U.S. city — treats black people like prisoners. According to the 2010 U.S. census, while 72 percent of Baltimore's population are people of color, 46 percent of the police force are white."

"A family travels to a remote island in southern Chile. On the trip, they try to convince their grandparents to financially support them in building a hotel in the place. Nicolás, the man who took them there in his boat, disappears, leaving the family trapped on the island, and the smiles begin to disappear. With cold, without water, and without certainties, the moods dissipate, exposing the tensions that each member of the family hides. Selva (13) discovers that death is just the shedding of our skin. We can become wolves, goats, shadows, or anything that fantasy allows."
"A study suggests that complex behaviors were transmitted over tens of thousands of years. Despite intense scientific research, there are still major gaps in our knowledge about primitive human life. One of the main questions that remains unanswered is: when were humans first capable of complex cognition? In other words, when did primitive humans develop sophisticated cognitive abilities, such as prioritization and cultural transmission, that we would recognize today? A new study in Nature addresses this; after six years of excavation, archaeologists have discovered technologically advanced stone tools that were created around 71,000 years ago."

"Of all the German surface warships, the British feared the Bismarck more than any other. Its size, speed, and firepower made it a definitive threat to Allied shipping in the Atlantic, and it was imperative to neutralize it.

It lies in three sections with the bow on its side, the middle section upside down, and the stern buried in the seabed.

"WASHINGTON - The RFK Stadium, the past and future home of major league baseball in the nation's capital, still doesn't look like a field of dreams. It's set up for soccer, not baseball. The field needs to be replaced, and the dugouts, locker rooms, and press boxes need improvements. On a rainy day last week, a quarter of the field was mud and tire tracks. It looked like Vince Lombardi should be coaching football here - which he once did for the Washington Redskins. But that was in 1969."
"Millennials are not a homogeneous group of people, so a one-size-fits-all marcomms approach won't work. Millennials want healthy food and are willing to spend more on it. Wait, no – millennials are debt-ridden and want healthy food at affordable prices. They're also high maintenance. But they're creative and tech-savvy, so that's a positive. And don't even try traditional advertising with them, just stick to social media. If all this sounds familiar, it's because it's a small glimpse into the countless contradictory reports about millennials."

"For a watching world, the vision of Britain in flames this week has surely been striking. The looting and fires have revealed a London, Birmingham and Manchester inner-city landscape that is seldom glimpsed in the England that is normally offered for export through soft-focus period dramas, Hugh Grant films or stories about Will and Kate. If the revelation has bewildered foreigners, it has confounded the British no less. The mood here is a mix of anger, fear and perplexity. It is not that we are unaccustomed to rioting: we are. England was in flames during that other royal wedding year, 1981."

"New research suggests that mice with Alzheimer's-like symptoms had improved cognitive function when given a synthetic hormone similar to estrogen. ""This synthetic hormone improved behavior in a way similar to estrogen,"" said study leader Dr. Christian Pike, associate professor at the Davis School of Gerontology at the University of Southern California. But unlike estrogen, which stimulates uterine growth and is a known risk factor for endometrial and breast cancer, PPT did not cause obvious changes in the reproductive tract of the animals. ""This could be a promising strategy to maximize the benefits of hormone therapy and minimize its risk,"" Pike said."

"Forget about announcing their latest album with a massive, over-the-top outdoor concert, Oasis has been hiring street musicians to do the hard work of promotion for them. A group of street musicians and street performers gathered on Friday to perform new Oasis songs at various locations around Manhattan. The strange crew included violinists, guitarists and - we can only hope - some of those gold-painted human statues. From subway platforms to park clearings, they played in all five boroughs - even in the torrential rain. Thoth and Dominic Del Principe were among those who got soaked."
"In her weekly therapy sessions, Julie revealed her most uncomfortable secrets: depression, debt, childhood sexual abuse. Her psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital would then type a summary into Julie's computerized medical record. With that, more than 200 pages of sensitive notes became available to any doctor who treated her within the vast Partners HealthCare system. She only found out about this when a doctor later referred to the notes. Julie, a 43-year-old lawyer, felt uncomfortable, then angry. ""The details are really nobody's business,"" she said. But Partners disagrees."
"To engage the private sector in healthcare, what is actually required is a significant increase in investment in the public sector to reach more people. The nation has a new health policy after 14 years. The long interval itself indicates the priority, or the lack of it, accorded to a sector that needs some urgent attention and has deep links with the nation's aspiration to grow faster and become a strong economy in the world order. The new policy has proposed seven key changes in the organization of healthcare services, including a welcome shift from selective primary care to comprehensive assured care with links to referral hospitals."
"The head of Vodafone Hutchison Australia (VHA), Iñaki Berroeta, has attempted to moderate expectations about the upcoming boom of 5G networks in Australia, saying that although his company is making progress, he does not anticipate consumer devices to be on the market until at least late 2019. Berroeta refused to discuss any spectrum ambitions for Australian 5G, instead emphasizing that the new ""ecosystem"" for mobile technology must be in place before operators begin promoting products. He said he expects ""most of the market"" to launch 5G within a period of one or two months once it arrives."

"I've just recalled why I abandoned financial journalism after 11 years in the post, including a stint as a correspondent on Wall Street. While the world of finance had its fascinations, I became increasingly disillusioned with the dominant narrative that it was always about the money, rather than other considerations such as values and social impacts, which never registered on the radar. It's not entirely surprising, given the testosterone-driven trading floor atmosphere and the fact that there is very little connection between the decisions made by city executives and their impact on the lives of ordinary people."

"Syria: Why is Assad advancing? In the presidential elections held in early June, Assad was declared the winner with 88.7% of the votes. This is not surprising considering the nature of the regime. However, despite the fact that these elections were not ""free"" at all, and that many people were unable to vote because they were in refugee camps beyond the country's borders, what has come to light is that a significant section of the population is supporting Assad. Why is this? Stop the criminal attack on Gaza! Yesterday, the Israeli army launched a ground offensive in Gaza."

"BlackBerry has decided not to renew T-Mobile's license to sell its products. A promotion that went wrong last month has led BlackBerry to cut ties with T-Mobile after numerous years of working together. BlackBerry announced on Wednesday that it will not renew T-Mobile's license to sell its products when it expires on April 25. T-Mobile offended the Canadian phone manufacturer in February when it sent messages to its BlackBerry users with an offer to switch to the iPhone 5s for $0 down.

"November 17, 2015 12:55 a.m.
Michael Hoeppner had to leave behind his Manhattan street smarts. We realized we were paying a premium price in Manhattan. We looked everywhere. We came to this area, and the houses are impressive, and it just seemed nicer. The people who sold us this house live next door, Rodney and Desmond. They already had a couple of offers. I think part of what happened is that they wanted us to be their neighbors: a pregnant couple trying to buy their first home. I'm sure that probably was more attractive than an extra 0.1 percent on the down payment or something like that."
"Mickey Boodaei has been a prominent entrepreneur in the security space for years. He co-founded Imperva, which went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2011, and co-founded Trusteer, which was sold to IBM for $1 billion in 2013. Shortly after this acquisition, he founded Transmit Security. Interestingly, Boodaei did this without seeking venture capital. He indicated that by investing his own money (and that of his co-founder Rakesh Loonkar) in the startup, he felt more like when he founded his first companies, but in this case, there was no one else to account to."

"WASHINGTON — South Florida has long been a laboratory for some of the country's toughest politics, with techniques such as phantom candidates created by political rivals to siphon votes from their opponents, or ballot brokers hired to illegally fill stacks of absentee ballots in the names of elderly or disabled voters. But there has never been anything like the 2016 election campaign, when a handful of Democratic candidates for the House of Representatives became the target of a Russian influence operation that made available to Florida journalists and bloggers thousands of pages of documents stolen by hackers from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in Washington."

"Hull - Where the United States goes, the United Kingdom often follows. This is especially true in the case of negative things. If the United States has extreme weather, we generally experience something similar a few days later. If violent crime increases across the pond, the same happens in the UK. Then there's the shopping craze. The UK is adopting traditional US activities such as Christmas shopping sales that leave customers with empty wallets and a variety of unwanted products. Black Friday has just passed and today is Cyber Monday. Each has become a major shopping day on both sides of the pond."
"More than a decade has passed since Eminem's sole starring role in 8 Mile, and it would be fair to assume that his acting career had begun and ended right there.

The project has now been acquired by the Weinstein company, and although Eminem is not technically out of the running, he may be on the verge of being replaced by some of the bigger stars out there."

""The polls are open, you can come in!"""
"As a veteran of the climate change movement, I've been conditioned to expect disappointments. So when, as administrative coordinator of Fossil Free Stanford, I was called into the office of the senior assistant to the president of Stanford University in early May, I approached the meeting with trepidation. There were good reasons for my concern. That same morning, Harvard had arrested a student demanding an open dialogue about fossil fuel divestment. The previous fall, Brown University had flatly rejected student petitions to cut ties with thirteen of the most polluting coal companies. Efforts to implement climate policies at the national and international level had fared no better."

In addition to reporting on Advanced Placement exam participation by racial and ethnic groups, the College Board's eighth annual ""AP Report to the Nation"" includes a breakdown by gender for all subjects tested. The data are for public school students in the class of 2011. Some of the things I learned may not surprise readers."

Exxon-Mobil says it's doing all it can to clean up the spill and has promised to see the cleanup process through to the end. That's not enough for Montana state officials, particularly its governor. They say the company hasn't been forthcoming about the extent of the spill and isn't doing enough. Michele Norris talks to Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer about those accusations and the actions the state is taking to address them."

"The airline operates 744 mainline aircraft that vary in size, carrying anywhere from 50 to 366 passengers each. For a typical 737 aircraft that carries 179 passengers, the reduction would mean about 11 pounds per flight. According to the article, stopping the sale of duty-free items on board, such as ""perfumes, chocolates, and liquors"", also saved 1.4 million gallons of fuel per year, saving United Airlines $2.3 million. Presumably, that also means that United was making less than $2.3 million selling the items on board or that they figured letting passengers pick them up on the ground would not significantly affect their revenue."
"According to the data provided in the 2012 Global Enabling Trade Report by the World Economic Forum, the country's macroeconomic fundamentals are solid, making it attractive to at least a fraction of foreign investors concerned about the euro crisis. The country's best investment opportunities are in manufacturing, the real estate sector, agriculture, mining, infrastructure, retail trade, and tourism, areas of investment that are largely untapped given the volume of foreign direct investment seeking attractive international opportunities. Manufacturing is particularly attractive to Japanese and Korean companies. Retail trade is booming due to the increase in domestic consumption."

"It's Tax Day: Remember the Krewe of Procrastinators on Loyola Avenue. Every so often, we come across a photo in The Times-Picayune archives that is so striking it poses a simple question: ""What is going on in this photograph of New Orleans in the name of Momus Alexander Morgus?"" When it does, we've decided to share it and try to answer that question. Photographer: Erby Aucoin, The Times-Picayune archive. What is it not?: Nothing as fun as those smiles might suggest."
"The yields on U.S. government debt rose on Friday after the U.S. government said job creation was stronger than expected in March, but wages grew at a slow pace. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.538%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 2.947%. Bond yields move inversely to prices. Job creation surged in March after a lackluster February, with a gain of 196,000 nonfarm payroll jobs, according to a Labor Department report released on Friday. The unemployment rate held steady at 3.8%, meeting expectations."
"The Duchess of Sussex's maternity wardrobe may come with a royal price tag, but yours doesn't have to. The Meghan Markle effect is in full swing, or should we say, full term. Since the Duchess of Sussex, who is due to give birth to her first child next month, announced her pregnancy last fall, fashion enthusiasts have been watching her every public move, eager to see what she's wearing and how she's wearing it. Such scrutiny is nothing new for Markle, whose style has become iconic since she joined the royal scene."
"Trisha Pollard believes Texas' social services system relies too much on courts to enforce Medicaid fraud law and not enough on a tool that was put in their hands almost nine years ago: background checks. ""It seems like such a simple thing,"" Pollard said on Tuesday. ""People in other areas of life are routinely subjected to background checks."" The 52-year-old retired attorney faced this issue last fall when she served as forewoman of a Harris County grand jury. During her tenure, Pollard and her fellow grand jurors returned indictments against two Medicaid providers, each of whom had a criminal history that included involvement in Medicaid fraud."
"Jennifer Garner was spotted out and about with her son, Samuel. Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck have yet to release photos of their three-month-old son Samuel, but this afternoon, Jen stepped out in Pacific Palisades, Calif., with her bundle of joy… completely covered up, of course. The beaming mom took her baby to a check-up at a pediatrician's office and smiled as she pushed him in his stroller. She even bent down and gave Samuel hugs, who is undoubtedly adorable just like his older sisters Violet and Seraphina."
"Protests erupt in Yemen, Tunisia, Egypt, Gaza, over a US film that insults Prophet Muhammad. A film posted on Youtube considered blasphemous has triggered violent protests and attacks on US diplomatic missions in several countries. Here, a Palestinian man burns a US flag during protests in Gaza City on September 12. Enraged protesters over an anti-Islamic film storm the US embassy in Yemen's capital. A Libyan man holds an English sign during a protest against the attack on the US consulate that killed four Americans, including the ambassador, in Benghazi, Libya."
"The Momtract from Mother New York agency grants headship privileges instead of flowers or cards. The New York advertising agency Mother New York has a suggestion for a gift for your mother, just in time for Mother's Day. Why not give your mother control over an aspect of your life? The Momtract, which they call ""America's most binding gift"", gives your mother authority over one thing in your life. The Momtract is based on the idea that what mothers really want is control, not sweets or flowers."
"Zoho offers a total of 43 different applications in its Zoho One cloud suite, but it has more in the works and is heavily betting on artificial intelligence and a new vertical partners strategy to drive additional growth. PLEASANTON, Calif.—Despite operating in the shadow of larger cloud-based enterprise software competitors like Microsoft, Salesforce, and Google, Zoho has achieved impressive customer growth for its highly valued Zoho One application suite. The jump from 25 million users last year to over 35 million a year later is notable, as is the fact that Zoho has signed on more than 250,000 businesses or organizations as paying customers."
"The dispute between the U.S. intelligence agencies and their democratically elected president, Donald Trump, is not only strange, but also, for that reason, an extraordinary case study to assess the mandate that should determine the relationship between National Intelligence and the Political Executive in a democratic dispensation. Ideally, the intelligence-based national security apparatus exercises the sovereign function of detecting and tracking any threat to national security, whether external or internal, with the aim of neutralizing it in a timely manner. At the same time, however, it does so under the authority of the elected Political Executive, who is the ultimate repository of all sovereignty in a democracy."
"The Australian men's water polo team has been agonizingly close to upsetting three-time defending champions Hungary in their qualification stage semifinal, losing 10-9, and will now play for seventh place on Sunday. As they have shown many times throughout this Olympic campaign, Australia is only one or two goals away from regularly beating the best teams in the world. They seriously challenged pre-tournament favorites Serbia in their semifinal before letting a three-goal lead slip away at the end of the game and led today with just five minutes left on the clock."
"The Sparks added some much-needed inside muscle on Wednesday when they completed a three-team trade with the Charlotte Sting and the Sacramento Monarchs. Center Rhonda Mapp and guard E.C. Hill from Charlotte and forward Latasha Byears from Sacramento joined the Sparks, who sent double-duty player Allison Feaster and center Clarisse Machanguana to Charlotte and forward La'Keshia Frett to Sacramento. Forward Rhonda Mapp of the Sparks has been dismissed from the WNBA and must serve a two-year suspension for violating the league's substance abuse policy, according to a two-sentence statement issued Friday by the league's New York office."

"MBOMBELA - National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete appealed to parents in general on Saturday to be ""kind"" so that their children can open up and express their feelings to them. Mbete addressed around 3,000 mourners at the KaNyamazane stadium in Mbombela, Mpumalanga, during the funeral service of Nokhwezi Mthembu, the daughter of African National Congress Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu. ""There is this feeling among our children that, as parents, we want to determine who they should be,"" said Mbete. Nokhwezi took her own life by hanging herself from the curtain rails in her bedroom at her home in the parliamentary village of Pelican Park in Cape Town on March 20."
"It's a long trip from Billings, Mont., to Lincoln, Neb. – anywhere from 850 to 902 miles, depending on the route you take. But that's the journey that seasoned and slightly dazed Woody Grant has just embarked on in the opening scenes of the new film by Nebraska native Alexander Payne. Payne has been nominated numerous times for Academy Award and Golden Globe awards as a director and screenwriter, and has taken home the gold for writing ""The Descendants!"", ""Sideways"" and ""About Schmidt""."
"KENTON, Del. - A cheese plant in Kenton closed by the Food and Drug Administration due to a Listeria outbreak has been inspected 10 times since 2000. An FDA spokesperson says that during that time, Listeria was never found at Roos Food's Inc. The agency also did not receive any complaints. The recent outbreak left eight people sick. Seven were in Maryland. One died in California. FDA inspectors found a multitude of violations inside and outside the plant during the inspection that took place between February 18 and March 4, 2014."
"England have called up Fulham's non-international goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli for the matches against Spain and Switzerland, while midfielder Adam Lallana has withdrawn. Bettinelli, 26, was not in Fulham's squad for the first two games of the season, but has since regained his place. First-choice goalkeeper Jordan Pickford did not take part in Tuesday's main training session. Lallana has returned to Liverpool to be assessed for a groin injury. The 30-year-old, who did not play in the World Cup after an injury-plagued 2017-18 season, joins Raheem Sterling in withdrawing from the squad."
"The extraordinary mummified remains of a 50-year-old woman discovered in a fetal position will be exhibited in a museum in France. According to a report in The Independent, the 1,000-year-old mummy was discovered in 2012 in the ancient Peruvian settlement of Pachacamac, near Lima. French archaeologists, who found the mummy wrapped in a fetal position, have taken care to preserve the integrity of the remains by keeping them in the same configuration in which they were discovered. The new exhibition at the Musée de Confluences in Lyon will explore various human representations of death across different ages and cultures from around the world."
"Guernsey voters are about to elect single-island politicians, rather than the current system of districts. More than half of voters backed the change in the island's first referendum, which had a 45% turnout. Option A - a single island district - won with 6,017 votes, representing 52% of the final count. It means all 38 of Guernsey's deputies will be elected in a single vote on the same day, every four years, from June 2020 onwards. More Guernsey stories and the latest on the referendum. Option A campaign activist Deputy Carl Meerveld said he was ""ecstatic and relieved""."
"We would also like to hide this list if we were Trump. Is Trump even his name? ""I don't think ISIS likes the Acro Cats. I don't think so. They're adorable and they're silly, two things that ISIS hates. In fact, the only thing they have in common is that they're a bunch of kittens."" One of the suits reminded Colbert of an acid trip. We'll take one of each. The CEO of Uber made his first appearance on Stephen Colbert's new 'Late Show', but it was far from a smooth ride."

"On Thursday, LightSquared presented final arguments for its $7 billion proposal to launch an LTE network. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has a lot of reading to do before July 4: a 1,000-page recommendation from LightSquared and GPS industry members, on whether or not America will get a new wholesale LTE 4G provider as soon as next year. On Thursday, LightSquared and the Technical Working Group (TWG) ordered by the FCC, which is made up of representatives from GPS-dependent industries and LightSquared, presented final arguments for and against LightSquared's $7 billion proposal."
"They seem a bit spooky, but vultures are nature's largest cleanup crew. They are amazing creatures with an incredible sense of smell, the ability to soar for hours without flapping, and steel stomachs. Learn about them on September 1 at Hawk Mountain in Kempton during Vulture Awareness Day. See a presentation by the Red Creek Environmental Center at noon. Kids can do a ""Eat Like a Vulture"" activity and follow the vultures from the lookout points.

The event is organized by China's Cultural Media Group."
"The center of the reconstruction is the warehouse, which was built in 1943, according to the date scrawled in the concrete. It is made of wood. The roof leaks. There is no air conditioning, not even a cold storage unit for fresh fruits and vegetables. The warehouse should have been demolished years ago. But the people of Poverello House moved forward, as they always have, accomplishing a lot with very little. When it rains, it fills up with water inside. The extreme temperatures spoil our food. And it poses serious pest control problems."
"Delicious, the original king of online bookmark sharing, is now in the hands of YouTube's founders, after a public outcry saved it from being shut down by Yahoo. Chad Hurley and Steven Chen, who sold YouTube to Google for $1.65 billion in 2006, will integrate Delicious into their new company, AVOS, and begin operating Delicious in July.

"Scout Gil Brandt, the last original member of the group that built the Dallas Cowboys from scratch, was fired by new owner Jerry Jones on Tuesday. ""(Jones) told me that finances were the reason, that he's losing $29,000 a day,"" Brandt said. ""They'll probably fire four or five scouts, including Bob Griffin."" ""I told him I know I did the best job possible. I feel good about the 29 years I had with the Cowboys. But it's a bad way for it to end."""
"There are many reasons to be skeptical of the 'smart home' in its current form, but Amazon's virtual assistant, Echo, shows glimpses of true potential. Here's why. I laugh at the idea of a ""smart"" refrigerator. I don't need my refrigerator to tweet to tell me I'm out of orange marmalade. Smart toaster, I mock. And smart locks on your home's doors seem like a particularly silly idea, unless you want to invite burglars in. I can understand why you might want a smart thermostat, like Nest, although it's overhyped."
"The action of Micron Technology (MU) is rising on Tuesday after the company reported third-quarter earnings and sales above analysts' estimates.

"It was a situation that left many around the world perplexed, not to mention the passengers on board the British Airways plane. Yesterday, a British Airways passenger plane that was supposed to fly from London to Düsseldorf landed in Edinburgh by mistake after its pilots received an incorrect flight plan. Flight BA3271 was operated by German company WDL Aviation - which was responsible for the plane and the cabin crew - on behalf of BA as part of a leasing agreement. It is understood that one possibility is that on its last flight on Sunday, the plane had flown to Edinburgh and back, and therefore repeated the same flight plan again on Monday morning."
"Two members of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians have pleaded guilty to a murder committed on November 2.

"She posted about Bozman on the Facebook group ""Out and About Troy, Illinois"" to see if anyone had connections to help him get in. After that, everything took off. Troy residents brought him food, water, blankets, warm clothing, and boots throughout the day, and were able to raise enough money to buy him a bus ticket to New York, where he had a friend he could stay with. Finally warm, he boarded the bus Wednesday night with a backpack full of supplies and a pocket full of money from the Troy residents who helped him."
"The Saturday night game was exactly like the Friday night game for the Amarillo Bulls in terms of scoring and outcome, and if they have one more game like that, they will have no more games. For the second consecutive night at the Cal Farley Coliseum in the Amarillo Civic Center, the Bulls ended up losing late to the Corpus Christi Ice Rays. This time it happened in overtime, when Corpus Christi's Kyle Moore scored 77 seconds into the extra period to give the Bulls a 6-5 defeat in a South Division semifinal series of the North American Hockey League."

"Maenga is not happy with his statement to the press against the apology statement of UTM president, Saulos Chilima. If he thinks Malawi is still living in the past, where its police lied to the nation saying Robert Chasowa committed suicide when in fact his party killed him, he is wrong. Today's Malawi is not willing to tolerate nonsense. A few weeks ago, when his party terrorized the nation, his president Peter Mutharika did not utter a word. Under growing pressure, the president instructed Mgeme Kalirani to draft a statement that did not address what the nation expected. To date, his government has not announced the identity of the terrorists nor have they been arrested."
"The ride-sharing service is returning to Taiwan with a revamped business model that claims to comply with local regulations this time. Uber halted its services in Taiwan two months ago, but is scheduled to return this Thursday. You simply can't stop Uber, as Taiwan has just found out. The global ride-sharing service will relaunch its operations in the nation this Thursday after pulling out two months ago, reports the Central News Agency.

The Florence Fire and EMS said all residents escaped before crews arrived. One resident was taken to a local hospital for evaluation, officials said. No injuries were reported to firefighters."
"With the economy starting to slow down, Ben Bernanke's war against the nation's savers continues. Some of these funds even pay juicy double-digit yields, such as the one my Permanent Wealth Investor subscribers have earned a 20% return over two years. Dividend capture funds: these funds buy stocks in companies that are about to pay a dividend, and then sell the stocks after the dividend is paid. By doing this, they can rotate through companies with different payment dates, and thus achieve a high dividend payout. The problem is that stocks usually trade lower after a dividend is paid, by the amount of the dividend."

"This paves the way for debt agencies to charge higher fees for overdue loans. According to an analysis on Tuesday by the Consumer Federation of America (CFA), millions of Americans have fallen behind on their student loan payments. The data, obtained from the U.S. Department of Education, reveal that 42.4 million people in the U.S. owed $1.3 trillion in federal student loans as of the end of 2016. Since 2013, the average amount owed per borrower increased by 17 percent.

"DENVER (AP) — The non-partisan administrator of the Colorado state Senate has warned staff, aides, and interns that policy prohibits them from speaking with reporters about workplace issues, including sexual harassment. KUNC-FM reported Tuesday that Senate Secretary Effie Ameen sent two emails reminding workers that giving interviews to reporters is a violation of the chamber's policy. Ameen sent the emails in February and March while Senate Republican leadership insisted that allegations of sexual misconduct and workplace harassment against lawmakers be handled confidentially, either under the Legislature's workplace harassment policy or by prosecutors."
"It was a Saturday morning. August. I remember it with great clarity. I was online, sitting on my bed, browsing, not looking for anything in particular. An article caught my attention: it was about the refugee crisis. Men, women, and children were risking their lives to reach Western Europe, and many were dying in the process. It was a story of terrible resilience and trauma. In response, I expected compassion, an increase in feelings of solidarity. But my heart sank as I read the comments. There was a lot of cruelty."
"The Central American referee Carlos Batres has fallen for the worst simulation of the World Cup by the most theatrical Italian since Federico Fellini. In doing so, it cost the All Whites of New Zealand a famous victory over the current world football champions. The scenes were reminiscent of Australia's defeat to Italy in the 2006 World Cup. Then, the 10-man Italian team scored a penalty in stoppage time after Fabio Grosso fell following a challenge from defender Lucas Neill. Fabio Grosso falls after a challenge from Lucas Neill during the 2006 World Cup. Let's not beat around the bush: Italy, winner of four World Cup crowns, cheated their way back into the game."

"The traditionally conservative Michelin guide, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary and a new, slimmer look for its mascot, Bibendum, has been generous with stars in France and Switzerland this year. On March 2, three French restaurants were elevated to the highest level in the rankings, three stars. Alain Ducasse's Louis XV in Monte Carlo regained the third star it lost last year, giving Mr. Ducasse a total of six stars; his second three-star restaurant, in Paris, bears his name. Pierre Gagnaire, whose restaurant bears his name, regained the third star he lost when he moved from St.-Etienne to Paris two years ago."
"He had the right look with his jeans and defined muscles. Many fans feel that the nickname was an unfortunate byproduct of his success at the time. On Tuesday, November 14, the real Rambo visited Springsteen in his dressing room after the presentation of ""Springsteen on Broadway"". Sylvester Stallone posted two photos on Instagram about it. The first is a photo of Springsteen, Stallone, and actor Benicio Del Toro, the second is a brief video of Springsteen bowing to the audience at the end of the show that shifts to a smiling and applauding Stallone in the audience. ""We went to the dressing room and spent some time with his wonderful family."
"The internet has changed beyond what could have been foreseen just five years ago. It is no longer just a means of navigation: it is full of Web 2.0 applications, real-time communication challenges, and a wide range of threats designed to exploit this new use. As a result, web security has changed irreversibly: it is no longer enough to block, stop, or inhibit IP sessions. Web filtering can no longer meet the security challenge on its own. This webinar will explain how internet use has changed and how your IT perception may not match what your users are actually doing, resulting in your security controls being bypassed."
"The fourth episode of Aaron Sorkin's The Newsroom is called ""I'll Try to Fix You"". That could perfectly be the title of the entire series. Like Sorkin's The West Wing, the show wants to fix America, this time through the story of Will McAvoy (Jeff Daniels), a successful, cynical, and bored cable news anchor who decides that he, and journalism, and yes, democracy, can do better. What does that mean! Will's producer and ex-girlfriend, MacKenzie McHale (Emily Mortimer), explains: ""Reclaim the fourth estate""."
"The Israeli ambassador and almost all the staff have been evacuated from the country's embassy in the Jordanian capital, Amman, amid growing fears of an attack on the mission similar to the one that occurred last week in Egypt. Fears of violent anti-Zionist protests similar to those that erupted in Cairo were sparked after calls for a ""million-man march"" outside the Israeli embassy in Amman. The action, scheduled for Thursday, had been organized through Facebook. The slogan, ""No to the Zionist embassy on Jordanian territory"", was posted online earlier this week and has already attracted thousands of commitments to attend the demonstration."
"The Maine State Lottery named Fuseideas as its agency of record. NL Partners of Portland, Maine, previously handled the account. The work will be carried out in Fuseideas' Portland office and will include broadcast, print, out-of-home, point-of-purchase, digital media and social media programs for the lottery. The agency will also handle media buying and planning. The new work is slated to launch in the spring. The Maine State Lottery spent $655,000 in measured media in 2013 and $565,000 in 2014, according to Kantar Media.

I have always paid my bill here. While they always create a fuss each time, they eventually accept my payment."
"My daughter, a resident advisor at her university, complained recently while mentioning that she would probably have to supervise more exchange students this fall. When I asked her why that was a bad thing, she told me that exchange students often assume Americans are stupid unless proven otherwise. They assume Americans are not as well-traveled, nor as fluent in foreign languages, nor as knowledgeable about the cultures of the world. I said what any good American would say: Why don't they just stay home, then? Oh, she replied, they don't think our universities are stupid."
"A few students have had what could be described politely as a ""disagreement"" at Graham High School. Kim Davis, one of the school's counselors, remains calm and serene as she helps to resolve the issue. It's the type of situation that counselors deal with all the time in Alamance County, North Carolina, and the rest of the United States. Davis' determination to do her job well while launching efforts to help students thrive in high school has earned her national recognition. She was a national semifinalist for the 2013 School Counselor of the Year Award from the American School Counselor Association, receiving the award earlier this month."
"I strongly urge the Mayor and Council to move forward to preserve the South Central Corridor. It is the only decision that will preserve the will of the voters, will not jeopardize the funding subsidy from the Federal Transportation Authority and will strengthen the value of light rail in Phoenix. Our leaders must stay the course and continue to support this important project. It is the only prudent course of action. Arizona already licenses the full complement of health professions necessary to offer patients a comprehensive approach to addressing chronic pain. It is time for health professions to work together in the best interest of our patients."

"A local state representative is calling for a major overhaul of the state's standardized testing system following the ""litany of errors"" that he claims affected the 2016 State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR) tests. Isaac believes that school districts should be able to opt for national standardized tests while the state works out the kinks in the STAAR test. When the STAAR test was last administered in May, problems arose with test administration, along with lost or delayed test materials, errors that erased test results, and mishandling of student private information, according to a press release."

"The New Zealand Abortion Supervisory Committee is appealing a High Court judge's decision that said there are grounds to question the legality of many abortions in the country. A registered professional can legally perform an abortion in New Zealand only if they act under a certificate approved by two certifying consultants, who are appointed by the Abortion Supervisory Committee. The appeal also argues that the Court made a legal error in concluding that the committee can form its own opinion on the legality of the consultants' decisions to grant or decline approval for an abortion."
"FOXBOROUGH - They are the football team of Camelot, extending perfection (17-0) into the new year, to a win away from playing in their fourth Super Bowl in seven seasons. The New England Patriots advanced to the AFC Championship game with a 31-20 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars at Gillette Stadium last night.

""We played well enough to win,"" said Belichick. ""It gets tougher at every step of the way in the playoffs."
"Johnny Depp has made a comment about his controversial participation in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald. Depp has been in his own world for quite some time, which has led to some very public controversies. The actor has been accused of domestic violence by his ex-wife Amber Heard, which has not sat well with Harry Potter fans. The fact that the production and J.K. Rowling have kept him in the film has left many fans with a feeling of disappointment. When asked about the controversy surrounding his participation in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, Johnny Depp did not evade the question and responded."
"RICH KARLGAARD: You have to look at 4 areas. One is financial regulation, which still makes it difficult for small businesses to get loans. You have the healthcare regulations that you mentioned, Obamacare is adding cost burdens everywhere, behind every corner and crack. You have the environmental regulations, and that's a whole area that's killing small businesses, particularly where I live in California. California farmers are being ruined at the expense of protecting certain insects. Then you have labor regulations. Last year we saw how the national labor relations board declared war on Boeing."
"In order to cause ""a distraction"", foreign actors attacked the country's main power stations that ""had equipment manufactured in Canada"", explained María Zakharova, and added that the perpetrators were well aware of ""all the algorithms and weaknesses"" of Venezuela's power grid. Venezuela began to suffer nationwide power outages last week. President Nicolás Maduro described the power cuts as ""sabotage"" orchestrated by the United States. He said that several ""saboteurs"" have been detained while trying to manipulate the power grid. Previously, he accused Washington of planning a coup against him, among other alleged subversive activities."
"Where were you when you received the 40 Under 40 award? It was 2009 and I was in my ninth year at Grubb & Ellis. In retrospect, I was a young professional, still honing my craft as a broker in the commercial real estate business, building my expertise and fine-tuning my client service delivery. What has been your greatest achievement since being awarded the prize? Although I appreciate being named a top producer within the company or local market, and I have achieved a high ranking in the volume of deals completed annually, I am more proud of my successes on behalf of my clients."

On Thursday, the Palestinian Authority (PA) announced it was delaying January salary payments to 137,000 government employees by at least two weeks due to post-election budget problems. The PA needs $116 million to cover the monthly payroll.

The plans include an extension to give the building a new lease of life as a community centre and theatre."
"The Japanese manufacturer Mitsubishi will make its first major move in the full-size MPV market this summer with a new and distinctive passenger vehicle called Grandis. Although it is not expected to arrive here until July, the British importer has shown its hand on pricing at a very early stage. Full specifications and prices have been announced more than three months ahead of the launch with the clear hope that anyone considering a rival MPV such as the Peugeot 807, Chrysler Voyager or Ford Galaxy will wait to see what the Grandis has to offer."

"Last June, the Tacoma Rainiers brought mascot reindeer Rhubarb and local icon ""Epic Sax Gorilla"" to the roof of Cheney Stadium, where the Triple-A club plays, for a trick routine that delighted the crowd. Also on the roof was Tacoma News Tribune columnist Matt Driscoll, who recently explained how the rooftop dance earned his employer and the baseball club thousands of dollars in fines from the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries. But buried somewhere in the pile of public documents I finally obtained, a single email — from a single individual — helped provide a more complete answer."
"Recently, my elderly mother visited her bank located in the Eastland shopping center in West Covina. As she was leaving, a woman carrying a baby in her arms approached her and asked for money for food for her baby, claiming that she had recently arrived from Italy and had no money or means of subsistence. As is so common in elderly people I know, she didn't hesitate to give the woman five dollars. Being the soft-hearted person she is, my mother asked her all the sad details. The woman thanked her and approached other people in the parking lot."
"The Jaiprakash Hospital is being renovated these days, with rooms being whitewashed, wall painting, etc. New facilities are also being added to the hospital. The outpatient department, pediatric ward, women's ward, and other areas of the hospital have been renovated and have a new look. Next on the renovation agenda is the hospital's upper floor. The amount sanctioned by the State Government to improve the hospital's facilities is being used for the renovation. An additional Rs 18 lakh has been sanctioned to carry out additional improvements in the hospital."
"Can faith be given a price tag? That's the question worshippers are asking themselves as the tradition of tithing, that is, giving 10% of your income to the church, is increasingly being questioned. Opponents of tithing say it's a misinterpretation of the Bible, a man-made practice, not God-made. They say they should be free to donate the amount they choose and are arguing with pastors, writing letters, and abandoning congregations in protest. In response, some pastors have changed their teaching and rejected what has been a favorite fundraising method for decades."
"The tide is changing in Frankston, with the Dolphins achieving back-to-back wins for the first time in almost six years with a 13-point win over Collingwood at Victoria Park on Saturday. Coach Simon Goosey had a five-year plan to transform the boys and turn them into playoff contenders, and the results are evident. Frankston beat last year's grand final runner-up, Port Melbourne, last week and stood firm against a Pies team that finished strongly on Saturday. The key, said Goosey, has been recruiting players from the AFL system. Michael Hibberd, Dylan Van Unen, and Mark Baguley are at Essendon, while Marcus Marigliani was on the Bombers' list in 2011."
"The sad demise of veteran actor Kader Khan has left a void in the Hindi film industry that cannot be filled.

"Will Chelsea change strategy vs. Arsenal? Judging by their body language, you would never think Chelsea are just two points off the top of the Premier League table. After an extra-time defeat at Sunderland in the Capital One Cup quarterfinals on Tuesday, José Mourinho looked like a disheveled man, a strange mix of irritability, tiredness, and defensiveness. ""It's possible we have to take a step back to be more consistent in defense,"" he said. ""It's something I don't want to do, play more on the counter, but I'm seriously considering it."
"TOKYO (AFP) - Almost half of Tokyo's residents couldn't name a single Paralympian and international sports officials are worried about the city's preparation to receive the athletes. As the 2020 Games approach, the Japanese capital has a big job ahead. ""If the Paralympics are not a success, the Tokyo Games are not a success,"" Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike told AFP in a recent interview. So, with the goal of filling the stadiums, Tokyo has undertaken a renovation of its infrastructure, making its subway system accessible to people with disabilities and approaching hotels to check their accessibility for wheelchair users."
"Four-term Governor Terry Branstad officially begins his fifth term today. Branstad, a Republican, left office in January 1999 after serving 16 years as governor.

Branstad is expected to take the oath of office at 10:15 this morning. Branstad told a group of reporters and editors last week that his wife, Chris, has urged him not to give a long and boring speech."

"SANTA MARIA, Brazil – The lack of investment by a band known for its pyrotechnic stage shows may have cost the lives of more than 230 people in a nightclub in southern Brazil, according to a state police inspector leading the investigation into the deadly fire over the weekend. Inspector Marcelo Arigony told reporters at a Tuesday press conference that band members knowingly bought fireworks meant for outdoor use because they cost only $1.25 each, compared to the $35 price tag for an indoor firework. ""The firework that was ignited was only for outdoor use, and the people who ignited it know that,"" Arigony said."
"In fact, for Sunday, temperatures are expected to be back in the 50s, and possibly in the upper 70s by January 10. But first, the National Weather Service expects mostly sunny skies and a high temperature of 59 degrees on Tuesday. The front will make its entrance into Fort Worth mid-day, but probably won't be felt until the evening hours, making Wednesday a cold wake-up with the temperature fluctuating just above the freezing point. Wednesday's high is expected to be 46 degrees with partly cloudy skies, followed by a low of 28."
"Several bills in the New Jersey State House are of interest to truckers and others who use the roads throughout the state. Repeat offenders for drunk driving may soon face stricter penalties for their actions. New Jersey law now limits punishment for affected offenders to a traffic offense. Bail is usually $2,500. The traffic offense designation allows drivers accused of drunk driving to continue driving while awaiting their court date. Under consideration on the Assembly floor is a bill to put an end to that practice. Instead, A3057 would increase the punishment for someone convicted of driving under the influence two or more times within 60 days to a fourth-degree crime."
"The ""Lord of the Rings"" star, Liv Tyler, stepped out just with her husband for the day. The Hollywood star could barely contain her smile as she watched the horse racing on the second day of the Cheltenham Festival, on March 15. Dressed all in black, the mother-of-three shone brightly as she peered through her binoculars to get a glimpse of the racing. The stunning brunette wore a black silk dress that fell just above her ankles, with a sleeve and a butterfly-patterned belt around her waist. She added a wide-brimmed black hat and clutched a small black bag with a floral design for Ladies' Day at the festival."
"Why is a flashy Dutch journalist on the payroll of the former Alaska governor's political action committee? A Mother Jones investigation. In recent months, Sarah Palin's political action committee, SarahPAC, has paid thousands of dollars to a mysterious company that has gone to great lengths to conceal its ownership. Addresses linked to the company lead to post office boxes. It has no website. Not even a phone number. Not even the California lawyer who incorporated the company knew who was behind it. But a Mother Jones investigation has discovered that this company is run by an unusual foreign political operative."
"CARILLON BEACH: Living organically is something natural for Leia and Andy Mayer, and their Sunrise Market & Café is just an extension of that lifestyle. ""I love how friendly everyone is. The culture here is really interesting. And I love the beaches and the sun,"" Leia said on Thursday while making pancakes from scratch at the café. She and Andy moved from Northern California to Seaside in February. The Mayers have adopted the Carillon Beach community, opening the café on March 21 and organizing the Carillon Beach Farmers Market this summer."
"The Bible teaches: ""Resist the devil and he will flee from you"" (James 4:7). It also tells us to stay away from those who are guided by diverse desires (see 1 Tim. 3:5-6). Many great men of God have fallen into carnal temptations and have potentially ruined their lives and ministries. Someone has said: ""It takes a lifetime to build integrity and a minute to lose it"". This is a true phrase. I believe that one of the most important reasons why leaders fall is that most of them have never intentionally established mental and emotional firewalls."
"The former Chicago police officer, Jason Van Dyke, was sentenced on Friday to six years and nine months for the murder of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, more than four years after the shooting. Jason Van Dyke, the former Chicago police officer whose fatal 2014 shooting of African American teenager Laquan McDonald revived the passionate national conversation about police shootings, was sentenced on Friday to six years and nine months in prison. The veteran police officer was found guilty in October of second-degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery with a firearm for the October 2014 shooting. The shooting and its video sparked protests across Chicago and calls for Van Dyke to face serious prison time."
"Led Zeppelin stole from the '60s group Spirit. And did ""The Voice"" steal from ""American Idol""? A recent court case has the estate of the composer of ""Taurus"" claiming that ""Stairway To Heaven"" violates copyright laws. Creatives have been borrowing from each other for centuries. But what constitutes real harm - commercial, artistic, or otherwise? How much of the original work was transferred to the new effort? This is always the confusing part. Music copyright lawsuits have been happening for over a century."
"Detailed update process, I hope it can be useful to you if you have no experience with this before. Let me take care of the back side and loosen the screws. Be careful, the keyboard connection to the blue connector is slippery, gently pull it out. Take the back side again and start removing the screws in a row. Remove the back shelf. Now start replacing the SSD. Good. It fits perfectly with the slot. Assemble the screws so they fit the SSD. Evaluate the SSD score, it amazes me again, 7.8 points. As far as I know, the highest score is 7.9."
"Optimistic about their first housing project in Cavite, property developer Century Properties Group Inc. (CPG) and Mitsubishi Corp. signed an agreement on Wednesday to create a new joint venture that will bring to the property market around 57 billion pesos in affordable housing over the next five years.

The man, described as stocky and in his 30s or 40s, took a nine-carat white gold diamond ring, an 18-carat white gold ring, and a 19-carat white gold ring with diamond stars."
"Jeremy Tucker is leaving the top marketing post at Nissan North America to ""pursue other opportunities,"" according to the automaker. A well-informed source says Tucker, who was Nissan's vice president of marketing communications and media, was let go. However, Tucker describes it as a ""mutually agreed upon separation."" The automaker's sales have been unimpressive and there has been some discontent among dealers over the lack of national brand advertising, according to another source. The automaker's total sales in the 2018 calendar year in the U.S. fell 6.2% compared to the previous year."

"The following entry is by Katrine Øgaard Jensen, who is one of the founding editors of EuropeNow, a journal of political research, literature, and art at Columbia University. She previously served as editor-in-chief of the Columbia Journal and as blog editor for Asymptote and Words Without Borders. If Poe had lived to read Alejandra Pizarnik, she would have given him nightmares. Revered by writers such as Octavio Paz, Roberto Bolaño, and César Aira —the latter of whom called her ""the greatest, and the last"" poet—, Pizarnik is one of the most important contributors to 20th-century Argentine poetry."
"Albion striker Simon Cox has emerged as a transfer target for Championship club Derby County. Rams boss Nigel Clough is keeping a close eye on the 23-year-old and will consider a loan move if there is any encouragement from Hawthorns. Sources in the East Midlands confirmed today that the former Reading and Swindon player is on a list of strikers being monitored by Clough, who is looking to strengthen his attack. The Pride Park boss is also interested in highly-rated Gary Hooper of Scunthorpe, Billy Sharp of Sheffield United and James Vaughan of Everton, who he signed on loan last season."
"Ken Block makes incredible gymkhana videos. But the New South Wales police didn't want Ken Block to make this particular gymkhana video — the one you see just above — in Sydney. So the Hoonigan team went to New York instead, leaving Australia in the dust. Here's the video they made — the video that could have featured the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Opera House and all our city's most famous icons. Ken Block's Gymkhana Nine was filmed to coincide with the release of Forza Horizon 3, set in Australia — so it made sense for Gymkhana Nine to be filmed in Australia."
"Rawalpindi: Secondary school students of Sadeeqa Learning System (SLS) Montessori and High School celebrated Autism Awareness Day, according to a press release. The senior branch on Harley Street organised a special assembly in this regard, creating awareness among students about Autism Spectrum Disorder, highlighting its causes, symptoms and ways to live with it.

"ANSWER: I will reduce property taxes. We pay the highest property taxes in the U.S. I have reduced property taxes in local government. I will repeal the income tax hike. Families are struggling to make ends meet. My opponent raised the income tax by 32%. I will support basic services for those who really need them. I will end the corrupt one-party system of Madigan. ANSWER: All new and recent employees into 401 K plans. Increase the age of eligibility, except for police and firefighters. Change the current annual 3% cost of living increase to the CPI."
"The images we have published from Yemen can be as disturbing as anything we have used before. Here's why we made the decision to publish them. Amal Hussain is a 7-year-old Yemeni girl with a worried gaze whose image is at the top of our latest report from Yemen, a country embroiled in war and on the brink of catastrophic famine. Amal is skin and bones, and her head is turned to one side, as if she can't bear to look at those looking her in the eye. Some readers may feel they want to look away too."
"Ballinhassig 4-17 Castlelyons 1-12: A polished performance in the second half propelled Ballinhassig to a crushing victory over Castlelyons in the Cork Premier Hurley Championship quarter-final on Saturday afternoon. Inspired by Danny O'Callaghan and backed by five members of the Cork intermediate team, the Carrigdhoun outfit showed many of the attributes that could see them return quickly to the senior ranks. While the forwards will grab the headlines, it was the performance of O'Callaghan and the solidity of the Blues' centre-field line that launched their offensive in the second half and a 2-11 (2-10 from play) scoreline."
"The US trade policy has become the top concern among financial directors, according to a quarterly CNBC survey. Approximately two-thirds of financial directors in North America and Asia-Pacific say that US trade policy will have a negative impact on their company over the next six months. Seven of the 16 biggest declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index this year have been caused by trade concerns. US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin appeared on Capitol Hill on Thursday to face questions about trade, tariffs, and NAFTA from the House Financial Services Committee. Mnuchin attempted to calm the growing uncertainty within Congress as President Trump escalates a trade war with China."
"January 29, 2015: Follow the money. One of the reasons the new peace talks are progressing is because factions with responsibility for large portions of the population are willing to compromise if this will help stop the rapid decline in living standards across the country. Economic activity is decreasing and shortages are increasing due to infighting between factions and especially because two governments claim to govern the entire country. Then there is all the Islamic terrorist violence. Although most Libyans appreciate the help of the Islamic terrorist groups in overthrowing Kaddafi in 2011, since then these groups have become a greater threat than Kaddafi's secret police ever were."
"What exactly distinguishes people from machines? Two things, really: creativity and empathy. No matter what develops in artificial intelligence, these are the two elements that can keep the agency services business alive and keep marketers busy for years. Artificial intelligence is a complement to what you do, it's designed to enhance your skills. Artificial intelligence can create a level of efficiency that companies otherwise lack and free them up to do the kind of work that has incremental impact. Agencies have been successful in the past because they are creative."

"A police officer has been kicked out of the force for his behavior towards his partner during their relationship. A Northamptonshire police officer who strangled his girlfriend in her bedroom and told her he would ""kill"" her has been fired from the force. It took his ex-partner a year to go to the police to report her experiences to the hands of Officer Greg Mead during their relationship in 2018 and early 2019. But in a misconduct hearing about the officer's behavior, the 28-year-old woman told the panel how Mr. Mead violently lost his temper on several occasions during their time together."

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington D.C."
