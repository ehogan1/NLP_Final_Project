The top election official in Louisiana has warned residents about potential scams targeting potential voters involving sensitive information, concerns that have also arisen in several other states. The scam involves a phone caller claiming to work for a voter registration assistance organization. According to Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin, the caller offers to register residents to vote over the phone and, in some cases, send absentee ballots to voters.

"For small businesses that operate on credit, accounts receivable make up a large portion of the balance sheet. During the annual audit, the auditor will verify if there is sufficient evidence to support your claims about the accounts receivable balance. These claims are called assertions. The most common audit procedure for accounts receivable is confirmation, where the auditor will ask your clients to confirm their account balances. Understanding which assertions can be verified through confirmation helps you understand why your auditor may need to perform multiple audit procedures to verify the same account. Accounts receivable confirmation is primarily used to verify the existence assertion."
"Fortunately, I am not Jim Furyk today. 1. The US team entered the final day of the Ryder Cup with a four-point lead in Sunday's singles matches, with the home crowd expecting another dominant display. 2. Luke Donald beat Bubba Watson in the first match of the day to make the score 10-7, but the US still maintained a strong lead. Anyway. 3. Europe's Paul Lawrie thrashed Brandt Snedeker to add another point for Europe. 4. At least America's best player, Keegan Bradley, was able to take on Rory McIlroy all weekend."
"This situation often occurs: you press the snooze button on your alarm clock once, twice, or even three times, and by the time you finally get out of bed, wash up, dress, and get ready to face the new day, you're already behind schedule. Usually, this results in you completely skipping breakfast. It turns out that your breakfast habits are a time-saving technique that should not be neglected. Firstly, research shows that eating a nutritious, protein-rich, and balanced breakfast every morning is an effective way to activate your brain, improve focus, and enhance performance. Additionally, eating breakfast is also associated with better weight control, as it provides energy for the body and may reduce hunger later in the day."

"The best Halloween costume ideas come from the most unforgettable moments of the year, and 2016 was undoubtedly a year to remember. We witnessed the Summer Olympics and the US Presidential Election, two events that dominate the headlines (and Facebook timelines!) every four years. Add to that Beyoncé's visual album masterpiece, the Pokémon Go phenomenon, and the colorful, quotable chaos of Suicide Squad, and 2016 was basically begging for a Halloween costume party. We've become Halloween experts - creating over 1 billion pages of Halloween content. This is our time to shine."

"We first looked at which major brands had the highest maintenance costs over the first 10 years of driving. We grouped all models by brand and year to calculate the average cost per brand. To estimate the annual maintenance cost, we found the maintenance cost every other oil change interval (as oil changes are typically done every six months). Without a doubt, the German imports are leading by a large margin. Toyota and its two brands, Lexus and Subaru, are one of the cheapest brands, with owners saving at least $10,000 over 10 years in maintenance costs compared to BMW."

"Veteran Congressman Jim Leach, a Republican from Iowa, lost his seat in the 2006 election. I'm not particularly defending ""moderate Republicans,"" but it's worth noting. In my view, Leach was absolutely the best Republican in the House. Nevertheless, one can only be pleased about his defeat. The fact that it happened only shows how bad the entire Republican Party has become. Leach was a person with genuinely good instincts and some basically correct ideas about how the United States should behave in the world, but he was useless in practice."
"Trump's tweets have long raised questions about whether they violate Twitter's anti-harassment rules. On Monday, after Trump tweeted that North Korea ""may not be around much longer"", Twitter was forced to explain why it had not banned the president from using the service. Twitter's public policy account posted six tweets in which the company said it considered ""newsworthiness"" and ""public interest"" when deciding whether a user had violated its rules. Twitter said these considerations had long been used internally to decide the fate of problematic accounts. The company said its rules were intended to ensure that all users could use the service safely, but also took into account whether certain tweets had news value or served the public interest. In this case, Twitter considered Trump's tweets to be newsworthy and of public interest, despite being controversial, and therefore took no action."
"No one can accurately predict when the stock market will end its record bull run, but the best way for investors to prepare for the next economic downturn is to stay calm and stick to a prudently crafted plan. The Star spoke with Ashley Feinstein Gerstley, author of 30-Day Money Cleanse: Take Control of Your Finances, Manage Your Spending, and Get Out of Debt Fast, to ask why people are so miserable about money — and how they can do better. People also often overlook or inadvertently misreport other common expenses."

"Notre Dame, Indiana -- The Irish took to the practice field for the final time on Thursday morning in preparation for Saturday's Blue Gold Game. As spring practice comes to a close, one of the biggest questions still remains unanswered: who will emerge at the outside linebacker position? Defensive coordinator Clark Lea said that fifth-year outside linebacker Asmar Bilal is currently the closest to being ""solid"" in the unit, but he seems content with the uncertainty. He believes the position has made huge strides over the past month and a half, but with a few months still to go before the first game, he's not in a rush to have all the answers. Despite no decision being made at the position, Lea is pleased with the progress the team has made and is confident they'll find the right guys over the next few months."

While people should be able to express themselves freely, they should do so in a calm and respectful manner. The video does not show the real me, I am not a racist."

"[Author: Jonathan Stalin] We often see and hear the two major parties getting into many unnecessary arguments in debates, a phenomenon that seems to be more pronounced during election campaigns.

Nevertheless, the issue of garbage and waste is one that affects us all, involving public health, social cohesion, tourism, and many other aspects!"
"The town of Narra is being plagued by terror incidents perpetrated by residents of Bataraza, Palawan, which are not the handiwork of extremists but of politicians.

Bidding Jubail, a 60-year-old resident of Bataraza, recalled the January 2 attack on the island town, saying ""we were helpless,"" which was allegedly carried out by Burahan's supporters using M203 grenade launchers and M-14 and M-16 rifles.

"German business confidence fell to its lowest level in two and a half years in October, marking a sixth consecutive monthly decline, dispelling any doubts that Europe's largest economy is being affected by the euro zone debt crisis. The Munich-based Ifo think tank said on Wednesday that its business climate index, based on a monthly survey of more than 7,000 companies, fell to 100.0 in October from 101.4 in September.

"The life of thought has always been a mystery that poets and neuroscientists have tried to chart and mark, but for me, it's about seeking it out. In Irish tradition, thinking itself is something worth thinking about, and so there are many concepts in the Irish language that involve thought, dreams, and imagination. As a student, many nuances are still unclear to me, but language is about conversation. I would love to hear more mature insights from native Irish speakers about words related to thinking in Irish."
"According to analysts, the market has entered a consolidation phase after the recent rebound. New Delhi: The below-normal monsoon forecast by private weather agency Skymet had a significant impact on the stock benchmarks on Wednesday, causing the stock benchmarks to give up the day's gains after reaching new historic highs. According to Skymet, the monsoon in 2019 is likely to be ""below normal"", with rainfall of only 887 mm from April to September, which is only 93% of the long-term average. This led to a sharp correction in the bull market, wiping out previous gains, and the market eventually closed in negative territory. The arrival of the consolidation phase means that the market may remain stable or fluctuate in the short term."

"Los Angeles - A proposal to grant subpoena power to the oversight commission that supervises the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department was initially set to be decided by voters in March 2020. The proposal failed to gain approval from the Board of Supervisors today. Supporters of the ""Reform LA Jails"" initiative collected nearly 250,000 signatures in support of the measure, which also requires the civilian oversight commission to study ways to reduce the county jail population and divert jail construction funds to alternative incarceration methods. Supervisor Sheila Kuehl said the issue should be decided by the county's more than 10 million residents. The Board of Supervisors failed to approve the proposal, so it will be decided by voters.

Hello, I am the wife of a Vietnam veteran, and I have three children. I had my first daughter in my first marriage at the age of 18, and then I had two more daughters in my second marriage in 1970."

"Two years ago, I was sitting in a South Atlantic League baseball game (Low A) watching the Hagerstown Suns host the visiting Greensboro Grasshoppers. Behind me, two Greensboro pitchers, Trevor Richards and Ben Meyer, were charting the game. As I mentioned, neither of the two pitchers seemed to be on the radar of any major league teams. Richards went undrafted out of a small junior college in 2015, so he had to start his professional career with the Gateway Grizzlies of the independent Frontier League. After a good 2016 with Greensboro, he was signed by the Miami Marlins."
"The United Nations, August 26 -- As media speculation mounts about a possible US missile strike on Syria, one cannot help but ask: will the US still launch a strike even if the UN investigation team is still in Syria, and even if they find something in the suburbs of Damascus? The question is: regarding Syria, British and US officials have stated that the current investigation may be in vain, as Damascus has had time to destroy some of the evidence.

Starring Steve Carell and Timothée Chalamet, the film depicts a young man's descent into methamphetamine addiction (as well as heroin, pills, and marijuana) in a haunting and unsettling way, as well as the efforts of a devoted father to save him. It's a true and terrifying story that even mediocre direction and clichéd writing can't diminish."

"Recent research has shown that patients with dementia can gain great benefits from art therapy. While many people believe that a healthy diet and exercise are key to healthy aging, the International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry found that certain personality traits can also have a huge impact on your life as you age. We all live busy lives, but if you have recently moved into an assisted living house or memory care cottage, it is even more important to stay connected with loved ones. Nutrition is important for everyone, but it is especially crucial for the elderly."

"Nothing brings people together like ratings and an upcoming contract negotiation. In a meeting in Midtown Manhattan, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination and the queen of primetime news put aside their differences. Donald Trump and Megyn Kelly, who had been publicly at odds, or secretly seething, or icily polite, met at Trump Tower on Monday, apparently ending their cold war.

"Preble County - In the past week, Preble County has seen two serious traffic accidents involving young people, prompting Preble County Sheriff Mike Simpson to discuss summer driving habits as the summer months approach and younger, inexperienced drivers become more active. According to Simpson, the roads become busier in the summer because young drivers are more frequently on the road since they are no longer in school. ""Kids are out of school on summer break, or college students are home on summer break, so you see more young drivers on the road, going to events or going to work, because they're not spending 6-7 hours a day in school,"" Simpson said."
"The families of the deceased bravely listened to the public details of the cause of death. Today, in the investigation of the Crusader helicopter crash, heartbreaking details of the cause of death of the deceased were read out. This is a legal mechanism proposed in a joint memorandum of understanding, which means that the prosecution and 14 other investigative agencies will not dispute these details. Gary Arthur, a 48-year-old sales consultant, was found trapped under the rubble of a bar, at which time he had no pulse. Rescuers found him with no signs of life. The autopsy results showed that he died from head injuries."

Murphy has a complicated history in the position, as he simultaneously draws a salary from a nonprofit that serves agency employees and the corrections department's retirement fund."
"As Californians, as people with a voice, we should understand what it means to displace people from their land. In the 1950s and 60s, California funded expeditions every year to remove all Native Americans from the entire region. But this is not just a historical phenomenon: in the West Bank, Israeli settlers and the Israeli government have been trying for decades to erase the small Palestinian village of Susya, located near Hebron, which dates back at least to the 19th century and was declared an archaeological site in the 1980s in order to allow settlers to move in and replace the former inhabitants."

"A cancer expert has found a way to kill tumors using light in just two hours. The technique involves injecting a chemical compound and then exposing it to ultraviolet light. In laboratory mice, it was found that cancer cells self-destructed, with up to 95% of cancer cells dying within two hours. Professor Matthew Gdovin revealed that the cancer cells he injected with the compound, nitrobenzaldehyde, became too acidic to survive. After applying for a patent for the ""photodynamic"" treatment, he said, ""There are many different types of cancer, but they all have the property of being susceptible to this induced cell suicide."""
"Recently, drones have appeared in various shapes and sizes, but generally speaking, most drones still belong to one of two categories. One category is the multi-rotor type (quadcopters, hexacopters, octocopters, etc.), and the other category is the fixed-wing type. Both types of drones have their advantages and disadvantages. Multi-rotor drones are usually more stable and easier to fly, but much slower than fixed-wing drones that focus on forward acceleration. On the other hand, fixed-wing drones can fly faster and farther than their hovering counterparts, but are more difficult to operate because they cannot take off and land vertically."
"Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche Holding Ltd. said on Monday that it had received reports of 13 cases of the H1N1 flu virus developing resistance to oseltamivir, which is sold under the brand name ""Tamiflu"", a very low proportion. David Reddy, the head of the oseltamivir pandemic task force, said one piece of good news was that people infected with the resistant strain of the virus did not seem to be passing the disease on to others. The resistant variant also tended to produce only mild symptoms, just like the widely circulating strain of the virus. The cases were spread across the globe, including Europe, the United States, and Asia."
"Russian President Putin described Turkey's downing of a Russian warplane as a ""stab in the back by accomplices of terrorism"", and said the incident would have serious consequences. Before meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah on Tuesday, Putin said in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi that the downed plane was attacked in Syrian airspace, just 1 kilometer from the Turkish border, and crashed 4 kilometers inside Syria. This contradicts Turkey's claim that the plane was repeatedly warned before being shot down for violating Turkish airspace."
"Arsene Wenger believes that the recovery of England forward Theo Walcott, plus the impending return of German international Lukas Podolski, means that Arsenal do not need to feel extra pressure to buy another striker in January. Arsenal will resume domestic action on Saturday, hoping to revive their fortunes by beating third-placed Southampton and maintaining their position at the top of the Premier League. Walcott will face his former club two months after undergoing abdominal surgery. Meanwhile, Podolski has been absent since August 27 due to a hamstring injury and is expected to return by the end of December. Arsenal hope that the return of Walcott and Podolski will help them maintain their position at the top of the league."
"The New York Knicks have completed a quarter of their schedule with a mediocre 9-9 record, aiming to end their 43-year championship drought. Coach Jeff Hornacek and the Knicks are expected to have an advantage over their opponents in December. The month will feature 15 games, with only five opponents having a winning percentage over 50%. They will host the 5-13 Minnesota Timberwolves at home on Friday. Joakim Noah, Derek Rose, and Carmelo Anthony are undoubtedly the team's biggest stars, but their performance has yet to meet expectations. Anthony's team-high 22.2 points per game is slightly higher than last season. Hornacek and the Knicks hope to achieve more wins in December, laying the foundation for the team's playoff journey."
"Hashem's bookstore had been a beacon of knowledge and a destination for readers and intellectuals until 2000, when visitor numbers began to decline due to the dire economic situation in the Gaza Strip.

"Ray Trew has stepped down as chairman of Notts County Football Club and announced that the Championship club has been sold. Trew became the owner and chairman of the club in 2010, but he said he made the decision due to his family recently suffering ""vile"" abuse. Notts County are currently 16th in the Championship, having been relegated last year, and appointed Jamie Fullarton as their new manager in January.

"To end the war on whistleblowers, the Espionage Act needs to be reformed. Over the past 100 years, the law has evolved into a tool for government secrecy. The evolution of the Espionage Act has had a profound impact on the freedom of modern American political debate. Initially, the law was a vague authorization that gave President Woodrow Wilson the power to imprison critics and censor the media during World War I. Today, it has transformed into a powerful law that regulates political discourse by controlling secrets rather than speech. Censorship did not stop with the end of the war, it has evolved. Despite its name, the Espionage Act has always been a broad authorization."

He hails from the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) in Bavaria, Germany. Weber spoke to EURACTIV Germany's Dario Sarmadi. British Prime Minister David Cameron has threatened that the UK will leave the EU if Jean-Claude Juncker becomes President of the European Commission. What is your view on the British Prime Minister? The UK belongs to the EU and is stronger as part of the European community."
"Conservative Party leader William Hague walked past a group of loyal supporters on his way to lunch on Tuesday, prompting sudden laughter, even from many of his own supporters, when the host introduced him as the ""future prime minister"". The London Times, which has consistently supported the Conservatives, expressed its support for the Labour Party and its backing of current Prime Minister Tony Blair's re-election for the first time. Ladbrokes, the largest betting company in the UK, has stopped accepting bets on Thursday's election and has started paying out on a Labour victory."

"From the M1917 to the M1A2, American tanks have dominated the battlefield. The US Army and Marine Corps are approaching a nearly century-long milestone - the 100th anniversary of the service of American tanks. This dynamic GIF, produced by the staff of partcatalog.com, showcases the evolution of American tanks, from the creaky M1917 light tank to the M1A2 Abrams tank, demonstrating the process of the United States becoming a world leader from a novice in the world of tanks. For example, the M1917 light tank was simply a replica of the Renault FT-17. Such engineering plagiarism is unimaginable today. Over the past 100 years, the US Army and Marine Corps have made tremendous progress, driving the development of tank technology and making the United States the world's leading tank manufacturer."
"Among these groups, the most notable name is Bajrang Dal, whose radicals in 1999 burned alive an Australian missionary Graham Staines and his two minor sons in Orissa. This heartbreaking incident is often cited as one of the early examples of ""saffron terror"" in India. Just as the Maharashtra police arrested three persons, accusing them of involvement in ""terror activities"" in the state, the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) said that the police found 22 items from the accused's residence in Pune, once again drawing attention to the phenomenon of Hindu terrorism."

"M. Night Shyamalan's 2017 horror film Split, the most exciting part was the ending, which was also one of the few things the movie got right. At the end, Bruce Willis's character David Dunn from Unbreakable appeared in a brief, shocking scene, creating a shared universe that Shyamalan was eager to capitalize on. However, there is a huge gap between giving fans a brief cameo and building a story around it. As the third installment of the trilogy, Glass looks like a messy combination of half-baked ideas, forming an unbalanced chaos."

"Sign the RootsAction petition telling mayors and police chiefs across the country that you support the right to peaceful protest unobstructed. In New York, Occupy Wall Street protesters won a major victory on Friday when Mayor Bloomberg and Brookfield Properties, the owner of Lower Manhattan's Zuccotti Park, backed down from their demands that protesters temporarily leave the park for cleaning and comply with new rules that would have banned sleeping bags, many types of equipment, and even lying down in the park.

"Senior tech executives discussed the impact of automation technology on their organizations. For many organizations and employees, technological automation is both an opportunity and a threat. On the one hand, the use of robotic process automation and other tools can improve efficiency by automating manual and repetitive tasks. On the other hand, it has the potential to make jobs redundant. Recently, tech executives in Sydney and Melbourne collectively discussed the impact of automation technology on their organizations. A key issue was how to ensure compliance with governance policies and procedures when ""robots"" replace humans in performing business tasks. Other issues discussed included how to manage the changes brought about by automation technology and how to ensure that employees can adapt to new technologies and new ways of working.

"Edgar Wright has never made a bad film, he hasn't even made a mediocre one. It's therefore understandable that Wright has thus far avoided making direct sequels throughout his career. However, this may be about to change with the arrival of Baby Driver. When Shaun of the Dead was a success, Wright, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost didn't capitalize on the film's success by making a zombie sequel, instead opting to collaborate with Pegg and Frost on a thematically related trilogy - the ""Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy"" - which also includes the equally excellent Hot Fuzz and The World's End."

"I first heard these scriptures in a small chapel in Kiev, Ukraine. I remember the day because it was a Sunday morning, and the news of Princess Diana's death was being reported. I had just left my job on Wall Street and was living with my mother in Kiev because my father had passed away, and I was feeling lost and without direction.

"Guess what, the NBA is actually an entertainment show. It's just that super producer David Stern is no longer behind the scenes pulling all the strings (otherwise the Knicks would somehow have won the draft lottery). Instead, the league is stumbling along like a wildly over-budget, out-of-control Hollywood blockbuster - driven by the egos of its star players, full of shocking plot twists, and suffering from endless rewrites. And it gets worse: we haven't even mentioned the Los Angeles Lakers yet. Unfortunately, the biggest news so far this season has nothing to do with basketball."
"Doug Newcomb 2015 Lincoln MKC If you're looking for a stylish and relatively affordable luxury crossover that's an alternative to the usual imports, the 2015 Lincoln MKC is an attractive choice. Relatively affordable. Wide range of driver-assist options. Quiet ride. Outdated infotainment interface. Less powerful engine than some competitors. If you're looking for a stylish and relatively affordable luxury crossover that's an alternative to the usual imports, the 2015 Lincoln MKC is an attractive choice. While Ford has been setting sales records and making profits, its luxury brand Lincoln has been lagging behind its competitors."
"NASA plans to insert a small robot into a volcano in Hawaii to collect data and map geographical features such as fissures and volcanic vents inside the volcano. Currently, a similar robot is exploring the volcano. Dr. Carolyn Parcheta of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said: ""We don't entirely understand how volcanoes erupt, we have some models, but they're all very, very simplified. The goal of this project is to help make those models more realistic."" According to NASA, the robot developed by NASA can crawl into areas that humans cannot enter."
"Hearst Magazines will be very busy in 2018, completing its acquisition of Rodale, buying some magazines in the Netherlands, and increasing the frequency of its two newest titles. Pioneer Woman, a magazine co-founded by Hearst Magazines and blogger, food network star Ree Drummond, published two best-selling issues in 2017 and will increase its frequency to four issues in 2018. Hearst Magazines president David Carey pointed out in his annual year-end memo that now is a good time to be in the magazine business, citing Airbnb's failed attempt to launch its own magazine, Pineapple, in 2014, which only published one issue. Hearst Magazines will also complete its acquisition of Rodale in 2018 and buy some magazines in the Netherlands, moves that suggest the company is bullish on the magazine business."
Activists insist that future meetings about Dundee city centre should include discussions on providing accessibility for people with disabilities. What was supposed to be a pleasant experience of trying Turkish desserts turned out to be a bittersweet one due to the chaos caused by the St Johnstone football match in the UEFA Cup. A nursery in Dundee failed to increase its childcare places. Dundee inventor John Cruickshank died at the age of 84. What initially started as an act of defiance quickly spread across the world. Angus Council ordered a retired couple to remove all bird feeders from the front garden of their home in Monifieth.
"The daughter of the Kannada tabloid editor today claimed that her father is ""innocent"" and will ""clear his name"" in the case. Her father was arrested for allegedly hiring a hitman to kill his colleague journalist. Ravi Belagere, the publisher of 'Hi Bangalore', was arrested from his residence yesterday for allegedly hiring a 'supari' killer from Vijayapura in northern Karnataka to kill Sunil Heggaravalli. ""In this case, no one has filed the first information report based on someone's complaint, it is a case registered by the police on their own based on the killer's statement."
"Manatees are large, gray, aquatic mammals with full-bodied figures - I'm sure clothing companies would try to say manatees are ""voluptuous"", trying to convince them to buy plus-sized jeans - that taper off into a flat, paddle-like tail. Adult manatees are typically around 10 feet long and weigh between 800 and 1,200 pounds. Manatees are one of the ugliest sea creatures created by God, and there are many strange creatures in the ocean. These facts are from the website of the ""Manatee Conservation Club"" - interestingly, the observation of ugliness is subjective, but it is obvious enough to be considered a fact."

"French woman Isabelle Dinoire, who underwent the world's first face transplant, showed off her new look to the public on Monday. Speaking in a slightly slurred voice, she said she now looks ""like everyone else"" and hopes to resume a normal life. Isabelle's pronunciation was a bit difficult to understand, but she recounted her experience of being attacked by a dog last year and thanked the donor's family for giving her new lips, chin, and nose. On November 27, doctors in Amiens performed a 15-hour operation to transplant facial tissue onto her face, which still bears a small circular scar."
"Did Donald Trump release his tax returns. For a moment, it seemed like Rachel Maddow had a genuine scoop. Then, suddenly, it turned out... thanks to MSNBC in the US, the claim that Trump 'paid no taxes for 18 years' was proved to be false. Moreover, Trump's tax rate in 2005 seemed to be higher than that of most politicians and his income was quite considerable. However, we cannot be certain if the report was selectively extracted."
"Pleasant Mount, Lackawanna County - School officials are requiring students who have not received the latest vaccine to stay home for several weeks as St. Peter's County deals with a mumps outbreak. According to North St. Peter School District Superintendent Dr. Sam Rey, there are two confirmed cases of mumps in St. Peter's County, one of which is a student in the school district, he said. Another potential case of mumps is awaiting test results from health officials, Rey said. Rey did not specify which school the student with mumps attends, but said North St. Peter High School is ""involved"" in the outbreak."
"During hard times, resourceful bakers turned to desperation pies: vinegar pie and green tomato pie, which are not typically on America's list of favorite desserts. Nevertheless, these and other desperation pies still exist today, showcasing the ingenuity of home cooks during the Great Depression. Some desperation pies, such as the green tomato pie, still have a loyal following today. Imagine being a thrifty farmer during the Great Depression, wanting to make a dessert for your family, but traditional pie ingredients, such as cherries or pecans, were too expensive or unavailable."
"There is a Speed Graphic camera here, which was once the standard equipment in newsrooms across the country. You may have seen them in movies from the 1930s and 1940s, where photographers wore fedoras with press passes in the hatband. The Speed Graphic was a big, heavy camera that required flashbulbs the size of light bulbs to take pictures at night, and it was the first professional camera I used when I worked on the high school yearbook and a part-time newspaper in high school and college. I have a Speed Graphic in the office that uses sheet film - you take a picture, then pull out the slide and load another."
"Anyone who has ever been frustrated with shooting video in low-light conditions will be excited about Canon's bizarre yet amazing new camera that can shoot full HD color video in almost complete darkness. The camera, dubbed ""multipurpose"" MH20F-SH, has a 2.26 megapixel full-frame sensor. The reason for the lower resolution is that each pixel is enormous - precisely 19 micrometers, which is 7.5 times the size of the pixels on Canon's flagship DSLR, the 1Dx."
"Is our efficient tax authority stifling the country? I have never seen the central bank release a report urging the government to cut taxes. But in fact, this partly explains why the economy is going downhill. In fact, as can be seen from these rare historical data, tax commissioner Chris Jordan and his team have done a great job in cracking down on corporate over-claiming. With the increase in productivity brought about by computer technology, the government's tax revenue has also increased significantly."
"It is not uncommon for a facilities manager to be multi-faceted, leading meetings, providing plumbing advice, suggesting decorating ideas, and ensuring the floors are properly cleaned all in one day. When considering facilities operations, the facilities manager considers the safety and well-being of all building occupants. To be a successful facilities manager, one must have a solid management background, technical skills, basic knowledge of construction, and an understanding of the technical aspects. The facilities manager is responsible for overseeing the physical facilities of a building or campus."
"A professor of communications at Texas A&M University wanted to understand the impact of changes in the newspaper industry on politics in our country, so she conducted some research and published it in the Journal of Communications. If you've noticed that political polarization seems to have increased significantly over the past few years, you're not just imagining things. Johanna Dunaway of Colorado State University and Louisiana State University, and her colleagues found that this polarization occurred nationwide during a period when the number of local newspapers and journalists was decreasing across the country. As Johanna Dunaway and her colleagues found, during the period when the number of local newspapers and journalists was decreasing nationwide, political polarization also increased."
"Washington -- An Iowa egg producer apologized Wednesday before a congressional subcommittee and acknowledged that his family's company had ""gotten too big"" before implementing some necessary complex procedures to ensure compliance with all government regulations. ""What I mean is, we got too big, and then we started to implement some necessary complex procedures to ensure we meet all the requirements of the government,"" egg producer Austin J. DeCoster testified before the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee. He is the founder of DeCoster Egg Farms, a company that has been linked to multiple deadly salmonella outbreaks in several states over the past three decades. DeCoster's company is believed to be at the center of the recent salmonella outbreak. DeCoster Egg Farms is a vast empire that has been the source of multiple salmonella outbreaks over the years."
"The Conservative candidate was disqualified for failing to disclose his drink-driving conviction, for which he was later found guilty. Ben Wong, 48, who owns a takeaway called New Dragon Palace in Silver Street, had been standing for the Conservatives in the Victoria ward by-election on May 2, but was disqualified after being found guilty. The deadline for nominations had passed on April 3, but he had failed to inform Somerset's local Conservatives about his appearance at Yeovil Magistrates' Court on March 21."
"Battfleck is officially no more! Ben Affleck has formally stepped down from his role as Bruce Wayne in The Batman, passing the torch to a new actor. Warner Bros. had previously announced the official release date for the standalone DC adventure film, set to hit theaters on June 25, 2021. Shortly after the news broke, Ben Affleck took to social media to congratulate director Matt Reeves, who will be leading the Caped Crusader into the future. It was later confirmed that the tweet was Affleck's way of bidding farewell to the character."
"When dining out, it's common to leave a tip, but a tip added to an order of milkshakes and fries at a New Jersey restaurant has left parents fuming. Melissa Desh said, ""My daughter came to tell me that every time she and her friends go to the restaurant, they are charged a tip."" ""When I asked her why, she said, 'because they're kids,'"" Desh said. Her daughter, Isabella, and other students from Colfax Middle School frequently visit the Wayne Hills Diner, located across from Hamburg Turnpike."
"Dallas - Like many Americans, Martin Jacobson was thrilled by the news of the Navy SEALs' killing of Osama bin Laden. But the Dallas resident has a deeper connection to the elite special forces who took out the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. Decades ago, he was one of them. During World War II, Jacobson was a member of a precursor unit to the SEALs, an elite force known for its secrecy, but back in the headlines after the bin Laden raid. ""I'm just proud of the SEALs,"" said the 89-year-old Jacobson."
"Northern Ireland is today dubbed the race hate capital of Europe, in the conclusion of a report on racial violence in the province. Human rights campaigner Doreen Lawrence, mother of murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence, attended the launch of the report in Belfast by the Northern Ireland Council for Ethnic Minorities (NICEM). The report highlights institutional racism within the justice system and questions how it is to be tackled. Racial violence in Northern Ireland has been on the increase in recent years, targeting not only blacks and Asians but virtually anyone perceived as being different."
"About 300 villagers from Kampong Cham province submitted a petition to the Chinese Embassy in Phnom Penh yesterday and held a protest in front of the provincial hall, calling on Prime Minister Hun Sen to intervene. The villagers told The Post that they want to put an end to a long-standing land dispute caused by the ""land grab"" by the company, and said they will not return home unless a solution is found, even if it means death. They claimed that government departments have ignored their pleas for help, while the company has used the judicial system to arrest villagers who complained about the clearance of their land."
"The incline bench press is a strength training exercise that targets the upper chest and anterior shoulders. The exercise is performed on an incline bench, where the lifter lies on the bench and grasps a dumbbell or barbell with an overhand grip, then presses the weight upwards over the chest by extending and flexing the elbows. Alternatively, an incline chest press machine can be used to simulate the movement, with the machine moving along a fixed plane. The incline bench press is one of several exercises that can help create a symmetrical and strong upper body."
"Klopp revealed his delight at ending Guardiola's Manchester City's 22-match unbeaten run, exclaiming ""What is that?!"" live on TV, while also hitting back at critics who said his defence is vulnerable, adding ""Shocking, isn't it?!"" Klopp was ecstatic after Liverpool beat title favourites Manchester City 4-3. In a thrilling match at Anfield, Liverpool were 4-1 up at half-time, with City scoring two late goals to make the game tense."
"No one asked me, but... if you pay dues to a neo-Nazi organization, subscribe to racist publications, buy tickets to Holocaust denial conferences, and own Holocaust denial DVDs in your video collection, you might be a neo-Nazi. You don't become a neo-Nazi overnight. You can change your mind and your way of thinking and become a new person. If you want people to believe you're no longer a neo-Nazi, you'll have to do a lot of convincing. It takes a lot of effort to shed the brown shirt."
"Brent Moloney's first step towards making amends for his off-field drinking antics in the finals series was quietly regaining a spot in the club's leadership during the middle of the season. The second step was more public and significant, with Moloney winning the Melbourne Football Club's best and fairest award last night. The 27-year-old Moloney took out the Keith 'Bluey' Truscott Trophy at the Crown Palladium, narrowly edging out key defenders Jared Rivers and James Frawley in the voting. Moloney's two midfield teammates, Nathan Jones and Jack Trengove, finished fourth and fifth respectively."

"Dartmouth - On Flag Day, June 14, students from the James M. Quinn Elementary School in Dartmouth gathered outside to celebrate the holiday. The event itself wasn't anything out of the ordinary, but this year's ceremony took on a deeper meaning for them. The reason is that Ted Cort, the cousin of Dr. Carol Calafati of New Bedford, is serving in Iraq. Earlier this year, around Veterans Day, Dr. Calafati asked her students to send cards to Corporal Cort in Iraq to boost his morale. The students responded to the request, made cards, and sent them to Iraq."
"Will UBS appoint Bob McCann or Sallie Krawcheck to a senior wealth management position. According to Investment News, citing two industry headhunters, former Merrill Lynch brokerage chief Bob McCann and former Citigroup wealth management chief Sallie Krawcheck are both potential candidates for a senior wealth management position at UBS. Earlier, the Financial Times reported that UBS's new chief executive Oswald Gruebel had decided not to sell the company's wealth management business in the US, despite months of rumors to the contrary due to tax evasion charges and the subsequent scandal."
"If the outcome of the US presidential election were to be decided by social media, Barack Obama would clearly defeat Republican challenger Mitt Romney next year. The Obama campaign has embraced social media, with the president having a large following on Facebook and Twitter, and the Democratic National Committee using private social networking tools to communicate with some campaign staff. There is also evidence that the Obama campaign is using social media analytics tools to gauge voter sentiment and track the popularity of campaign messages. Despite attempts to contact both campaigns to discuss their social media strategies, neither responded."
"We should stop defining what impact investing is. Now that they're gone, we can get to work. I've spent the last four years as a contributor to Forbes, covering impact investing and writing hundreds of articles on the topic. The problem is, most impact investing is only available to the wealthy. This is a guide to impact investing for everyone else, which is to say, the 98% of the population that doesn't qualify to invest alongside the rich."

"Today is expected to be a sunny day as a high-pressure system sets up over the weekend. Following a chilly start, temperatures will rise to the 40s to 50s. It is expected to be cooler tonight under mostly clear skies, with lows ranging from the 20s to 30s and 30s to 40s. Tomorrow, winds will be from the south, which means we will see some milder temperatures, with highs expected to reach the 50s to 60s, and even 60s to 70s in some areas. However, more clouds are expected to develop during the day. The clouds appear to thin out at night, with lows ranging from the 30s to 40s and 40s to 50s."
"It looks like a scene after an earthquake, with orange cardboard boxes scattered all over the floor, shoes stuffed into every gap, and people standing in a state of shocked stupor. But this is not a natural disaster, just a Black Friday at a Nike factory store in Seattle. The Seattle Premium Outlets in Tulalip, Washington, shared photos and videos after the holiday, showing customers trampling the orange cardboard boxes originally used to protect Nike shoes, wandering aimlessly in the store, picking up and discarding athletic shoes, presenting a horrific scene."
"The 27th annual Southern Iowa Hot Air Balloon Festival is being held in Creston this weekend. Bill Fastenow, a spokesperson for the Balloon Committee, stated that wind is the key factor in determining whether hot air balloons will fly and in which direction they will go. Fastenow said that a pilots' meeting will be held at 4:30 this afternoon, followed by a ""Night Glow"" at the Creston Airport on the south side of town, which he described as a beautiful sight.

"The unemployment rate in Stark County fell to 6.8% in August, the lowest since September 2008. Stark County's unemployment rate was below 7% for the first time, and there were several reasons for the decline. The most likely reason was the oil and gas drilling of the Utica Shale, which brought numerous businesses to the area. The first to arrive were oil exploration companies, followed by engineering and construction companies that provided a variety of services. Manufacturing also experienced growth due to increased demand for steel and drilling equipment from both local and national sources."
"A horror movie icon will be visiting a haunted attraction in Gaston County on Wednesday and Thursday. Actor Derek Mears, known for his roles in Friday the 13th (2009), Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, Predator, and Men in Black II, will be meeting with horror movie fans at The Haunted Mill in Belmont.

Spot gold prices rose 0.2% to $1,294.11 per ounce, while US gold futures were basically flat at $1,293.75 per ounce.

The dollar temporarily stopped rising after its recent surge, while the pound stabilized after British Prime Minister Theresa May won a vote of confidence in Parliament and urged lawmakers to break the Brexit agreement deadlock."
"President Zuma believes the Public Protector's report on state capture is a political tool used to target certain individuals. In an exclusive interview with ANN7 on Monday night, President Zuma shared his views on the report by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela on state capture. The report recommended that President Zuma appoint a judicial commission of inquiry headed by a judge chosen by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng to investigate allegations of state capture. The report investigated whether President Zuma's friends, the controversial Gupta family, had undue influence over the government. President Zuma's claim that the report is a political tool has sparked widespread controversy."
"We like it because: few things are more stylish than a good night's sleep. After all, a well-rested night can make you look radiant in the morning - and also feel refreshed. One of the most important factors affecting sleep quality is a good mattress. The new mattress comes in a variety of sizes, from single to California king size, all made of five layers of ""high-end"" foam, including one inch of ""flo"" foam, one and a half inches of latex foam, one and a half inches of memory sponge foam, and one and a half inches of high elasticity foam, with supportive cold condensation columns inside."

"When the theme of the convention seemed to be ""Drill, baby, drill,"" an energy policy that sounded like ""Tax, baby, tax"" - fiscal policy (i.e., it wasn't), it was clear that this was one of the few things left that the party had. If you think that increased offshore drilling will improve oil exploration and supply, you can't be serious about these people. Unfortunately, yes, you can. At this point, I completely lost interest in the convention."
"The new chairman of the National Children's Hospital board has said that allowing the hospital's main contractor to exit its role would be a ""bad business decision"". The new chairman, Fred Barry, made the comments at an Oireachtas health committee meeting this morning, and also stated that the project had been undercosted from the start, leading to a massive increase in costs from an estimated €800m in 2014 to €1.73bn now."
"Bob Cannard was turning compost with a shovel at Green String Farm outside Petaluma, California, on Friday, March 6, 2009. The compost came from food scraps in San Francisco. As a parent and one who has worked with parents over the years, I was shocked by the front-page story in the El Cerrito edition about the death of an infant: ""Baby dies in car: A tragic lesson for all parents,"" June 10, 2009. The notion that a parent could ""easily forget the child was left in the back seat"" is, unfortunately, true."

Consequence: Incorrect labels could result in the vehicle being overloaded, increasing the risk of a crash."
"An attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union today asked a federal appeals court in San Francisco to block a California law that requires police to collect DNA samples from anyone suspected of a felony. The law, which was part of a 2004 voter initiative, expanded DNA collection in the criminal justice system through the use of cheek swabs. Four plaintiffs are challenging the 2009 provision, which mandates DNA sampling for anyone suspected of a felony, regardless of whether they are charged or convicted of a crime."
"Is that really the case? Are things really that complicated? According to a report by Green Bay News, the police stated that they would only need two to three weeks to complete the investigation into the alleged sexual assault case involving Packers tight end Brandon Bostick. Bostick was accused by two women from Milwaukee of sexually assaulting them after a charity event at a resort in Lake Delton, Wisconsin. The incident occurred on June 5, and a few days after the incident, police officials indicated that they doubted the incident would lead to any charges. One major issue was that the women's stories changed, initially involving multiple Packers players, and later only involving Bostick."
"To help determine the Seminole County community's perception of the Seminole County School District, at least one of the top four winning designs from the county logo contest will be chosen to develop a new logo. School board members have stated that they want a new logo because the current logo - a school crossing sign - does not reflect the district's academic achievements. The contest was divided into four age groups: elementary for ages 10 and under, middle school for ages 11-14, high school for ages 15-18, and adult for ages 19 and over."

Coach Terry Murray initially said the Slovenian All-Star had a broken ankle that would keep him out for at least six weeks, but the Kings ultimately determined it was only a severe high ankle sprain. Kopitar leads the Kings with 25 goals and 43 assists."

Police initially received a report of the accident at 1:10 pm. ""There were two accidents in the same area in a short space of time. It appears one truck drove off the road, then a car and a truck collided."""

"Data released by the Korean Shipbuilders' Association confirmed the expectations of many analysts: the number of active shipyards around the world has decreased by more than 40% compared to seven years ago. The study defines an active shipyard as one that has at least one ship under construction. According to the association's data, the number of active shipyards in China decreased from 380 to 140, and the number of shipyards in Japan decreased from 70 to 60 during the same period. What's worse, the world's largest shipyards - Daewoo Shipbuilding, Hyundai Heavy Industries, and Samsung Heavy Industries - may face idle space and underutilized capacity at some point next year."

"Brands should resist the temptation to tackle sensitive topics in the Super Bowl to draw attention, said Aimee Drolet, a professor of marketing and behavioral decision-making at the University of California, Los Angeles's Anderson School of Management: ""Generally, it's not the best venue to do these things because the audience is so broad, you're always going to offend half the people,"" she said. In other news, University of California officials announced that the system's 10 campuses set new fundraising records in 2017-18, raising more than $2.7 billion."
"Margaret O'Brien, 69, immigrated to England's Wolverhampton from Canada in 1971, got married, and had three children. She worked for the local council for over 25 years, doing various jobs such as a waitress, a restaurant waitress, a traffic warden, and a cleaner.

"We don't label them, as long as they're happy, okay. Alright, I'll just say it, everyone's been speculating whether Taylor Swift and Calvin Harris are a couple: they're just dating. You must have heard Taylor's 2014 song ""I Know Places"". The song is about developing a romantic relationship while being chased by paparazzi.

"The Kelly family's annual gathering is usually a pleasant affair. Organized by New York Post columnist Keith J. Kelly, the party has been held for three years at Langans bar on 47th Street, right around St. Patrick's Day. Attendees - media types and others with a connection to the Kelly name and its attendant Irish tradition - celebrate with corned beef and cabbage, and a pint or two of Guinness.

"New York - Just past noon on Wednesday, Australian Ambassador and President of the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty Conference, Peter Woolcott, released the final version of the global gun control agreement. After releasing the document, Woolcott notified representatives that they had 24 hours to review the document with their respective governments, then return the next day for a final vote. For several reasons, the U.S. delegation must choose the latter. Here are several provisions of the proposed agreement, each of which requires the federal government to unconstitutionally infringe on the Second Amendment right of Americans to keep and bear arms. The main provisions of the proposed agreement include: requiring national governments to monitor gun owners, record gun transactions, and restrict the possession of certain types of guns by civilians. These provisions are obviously in conflict with the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects the right of citizens to bear arms. The U.S. delegation must carefully review these provisions and consider their impact on the right of American citizens to bear arms."

"Searching for ""toxic yeast"" yields hundreds of frightening warnings and ""studies"", but most of these studies lack scientific basis and are often driven by economic interests. Recently, one of my patients was hospitalized for alcoholic liver failure. He had a long history of liver disease, but insisted that no one had ever told him to avoid drinking. Initially, he admitted to only having ""a few drinks"", but as other medical staff questioned him further, his story became more detailed. Despite his liver being in severe shock, he remained stable, and fortunately, most of his liver function was still intact."
"It is easy to lose democratic mechanisms, but it is difficult to restore them, said Bishop Jefferies Schori, the incoming General Secretary of the Lutheran World Federation, in a speech at St. Paul's Cathedral in London. He called on Christians to take action against injustices in the world. The Catholic Church in Scotland has been questioned for planning to charge the congregation during the Pope's visit to Glasgow. ""Eleanor's pumpkin grew very fast this week, and she has been checking on it."" The position of General Secretary of the Lutheran World Federation will be taken over by a new bishop, who made these remarks in a speech at St. Paul's Cathedral in London, and called on Christians to take action against injustices in the world."

"It may not be as well-known as Roku, Chromecast, or Fire TV, but Nvidia's Shield TV is still a powerful streaming device that deserves to be included on the list of best media streaming devices.

But don't worry, because Nvidia has announced that its Android-based streaming box will also be getting Alexa control support."
"Dundee United will begin talks in the coming days in an attempt to prevent Scottish forward Steven Thompson from leaving the club for free in the summer. Tannadice chairman Eddie Thompson is furious that recently sacked manager Alex Smith and the previous board did not take action to tie the 23-year-old Thompson down to a new contract. Thompson's current deal is due to expire next summer when he will be 24, meaning he can leave on a free transfer and United will not receive any compensation. He will be able to negotiate with potential new clubs from January."
"When searching for properties, no one cares about community expertise or excellent service. Mobile devices are now the preferred way to interact with the online world, whether it's destinations or content. Video is no longer an option, use it to create real presentations, or you will be left behind. I have a confession to make: I don't attend Inman Connect to network. At least, not like most people do. As a marketing director for an industry supplier, my day-to-day job is to educate real estate agents. But when I come to Inman Connect, I can learn from them."

"By detaining Haniyeh, Israel conveyed a message that the era of smuggling cash into Palestinian territory has come to an end. Since Hamas came to power earlier this year, the international community has cut off financial aid to the Palestinian Authority, and Hamas has smuggled millions of dollars into Gaza through the Rafah crossing, an open secret. However, on Thursday, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert decided to close the Rafah crossing to prevent Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh from bringing $35 million into Gaza, the first time Israel has taken proactive measures to prevent the flow of funds."

""I have to say, I was actually quite angry,"" he said, referring to the strong backlash from the White House and the Gulf of Mexico. ""I hadn't seen my son for three months."""
"It's safe to say that Cleveland Browns cornerback and Arizona State alum Damarious Randall didn't anticipate this kind of reaction. After the Warriors forced the Cleveland Cavaliers into a Game 7 on Monday night, Randall made a guarantee on Twitter: ""If the Cleveland Cavaliers win the 2018 NBA championship I'll buy everyone who retweet's this a jersey."" As of Wednesday afternoon, Randall's tweet had been retweeted over 800,000 times. That's a staggering number – Randall likely can't afford to buy jerseys for that many people."

"Dundee has long been a city of contrasts, with great wealth and extreme poverty coexisting. If the new V&A can bring about a turning point, then it will be worth it. I declare my interest. I studied at the University of Dundee and spent my final year at the University of St Andrews, and like many people who have been touched by the city, I have a deep affection for it and its people. Not everyone can accept this. At that time, a ""clearing"" scheme sent a large number of last-minute students to the remote Dundee College of Education, where they had originally hoped to go. Before the opening of the V&A Museum in 2018, Dundee's urban image had been controversial."

An Estonian immigrant and his accomplice had initially planned to commit suicide due to hunger and bankruptcy because they felt abandoned by the Estonian community, but they decided to kill a woman living in North Hollywood first, because they believed she was the root of their problems, so she wouldn't mock their death.

"The internet is moving forward with the development of the world. Early networks: UNIX commands were beautiful if you knew how to use them. This month, the World Wide Web is celebrating its 20th birthday, and the whole world is celebrating its birthday. It's a pleasant change, as this medium was once a new frontier of hope, but has been viewed with suspicion after the Cambridge Analytica scandal. We spent many years being angry about our choices of washing machines and underwear being influenced by smart web ads, and in 2018, we learned that even voters' choices could be manipulated."

However, it's worth noting that despite the two explosions and possibly more, many people rushed to the scene. Many of them were professionals. The finish line of the marathon is an ideal location for an explosion because there are usually doctors, police, ambulances, and so on. At the time of the incident, there were also some soldiers on site. However, there were also some non-professionals.

""The eyes of the world are on South Carolina,"" Guber said on Tuesday, adding that lawmakers' decision on whether to impeach Sanford will have an impact on the state's future governors and the state as a whole. Guber said that Sanford's disappearance for five days in June to secretly visit his mistress in Argentina does not meet the high standard required for impeachment under the state constitution, which requires serious crimes or other serious misconduct. While Sanford's behavior was misconduct, it does not constitute serious crimes, and therefore he should not be impeached."

So far, the Israeli Prime Minister has refused to agree to the White House's request to unconditionally stop all settlement expansions.

"Two groups concerned about mental health care want to know which Vermont doctors received thousands of dollars in gifts from pharmaceutical companies last year. Due to a law protecting trade secrets, pharmaceutical companies can keep some names confidential. The two groups believe this loophole should be closed. Last year, Vermont doctors and other healthcare providers received approximately $3.1 million in gifts from pharmaceutical companies. Vermont is one of the few states that require pharmaceutical companies to disclose such marketing expenses. These payments include consulting fees, travel fees, gifts, and speaking fees. The two groups believe that pharmaceutical companies may be bribing doctors to influence their prescribing habits, which could affect patient health. Therefore, they are calling for the closure of this loophole to make the names of all doctors who receive gifts from pharmaceutical companies publicly transparent. The two groups hope to protect patients' right to health and increase transparency and fairness in the healthcare system through this approach."

"Everyone remembers where they were and what they were doing when the 911 incident occurred. Chuck was getting ready for work at that time, while I was watching Fox News on the computer, with horrific images appearing on the screen. I had the TV sound turned off, so I only saw flames coming out of a building in New York. When I turned on the sound, the news anchor's words sounded completely nonsensical. It's strange that my eyes were filled with tears before I even knew what had happened and why. Interestingly, your intuition takes control of your thoughts before your brain reacts."

Orwell described Newspeak as ""the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year"". Orwell's idea of creating Newspeak was to build a world where all nuances of language would be eliminated, thereby strengthening the state's total control. Calling something its complete opposite can also be an example of Orwellian Newspeak, such as calling a bill filled with social program spending an economic stimulus package."

Municipal policies vary across Kansas and Missouri."

The latest data collected by the Delray Beach Police Department shows the city had fewer overdose cases in March than last year and in 2016, when the number of overdose cases reached a record high.

"Among all the German surface warships, the British feared the Bismarck the most. It posed a significant threat to the Allied ships in the Atlantic and had to be sunk. In July 2001, the wreck of the Hood was discovered at a depth of 9,334 feet below the surface of the Denmark Strait. It was found to be broken into three parts, with the bow upright, the middle section upside down, and the stern deeply buried in the seabed. In 2013, the wreck was further explored by a remotely operated vehicle."
"The input text appears to be a mixture of Chinese and English characters as well as punctuation marks, but due to the chaotic nature of the text, its overall meaning is unclear.

If attempting to extract and translate recognizable Chinese parts, it may be found that:

- "","" translates to ""and""
- "","" in this case translates to ""and"" or ""comma"", but its usage is ambiguous in the absence of clear sentences
- ""!"" translates to an exclamation mark

However, due to the lack of coherent sentences or vocabulary in the input text, it is impossible to provide a meaningful translation that conveys specific information or ideas. The text seems to be a jumbled combination of characters and symbols without a clear structure or context, making it impossible to provide a clear translation."

"Washington - RFK Stadium, once and future home of the nation's capital Major League Baseball team, is not an ideal venue now. It is configured as a soccer field, not a baseball field. The grounds need to be changed, the seats, locker rooms and press box need to be upgraded. Last week, on a rainy day, a quarter of the field was mud and tire tracks. It looks like a place where Vince Lombardi should be coaching football - and he did, for the Washington Redskins in 1969. But that was 1969."
"The millennial generation is not a homogeneous group, and therefore a unified marketing strategy does not work. Millennials want healthy food and are willing to pay more for it. No, wait - millennials are saddled with debt but still want affordable healthy food. They are also very concerned about privilege issues. They are creative and tech-savvy, which is a good thing. And whatever you do, do not try to reach them through traditional advertising, but rather through social media. All of this sounds familiar because it is just a small part of the many contradictory reports about millennials."

"The events that took place in the UK this week have undoubtedly shocked audiences around the world. The looting and arson have exposed the inner city landscapes of London, Birmingham, and Manchester, which is a far cry from the image of England that is typically presented to the outside world through period dramas, Hugh Grant movies, or stories about Prince William and Kate Middleton. If this exposure has left outsiders feeling perplexed, it has equally left the British feeling bewildered. The current atmosphere in the UK is a mix of anger, fear, and confusion. It's not that we're unaccustomed to riots; we are. England experienced riots in 1981, the year of the royal wedding. The British are confused and concerned about the causes and consequences of these riots, asking themselves why this happened and how it can be prevented from happening again. Many aspects of British society have been affected by these riots, leaving people feeling uncertain and anxious about the future."

"Recent studies have shown that after inducing Alzheimer's-like symptoms in mice, their cognitive function improved after receiving synthetic estrogen-like hormones. Dr. Christian Pike, associate professor of gerontology at the University of Southern California and leader of the research team, said: ""This synthetic hormone improves behavior in a way similar to estrogen."" However, while estrogen can cause uterine enlargement and is a known risk factor for uterine and breast cancer, PPT did not significantly alter the reproductive tract of animals. This ""may be a promising strategy to maximize the benefits of hormone therapy while minimizing its risks,"" Dr. Pike said."

The motley crew included a violinist, guitar player, and of course, some ""living statues"" covered in gold paint. They performed in all five boroughs, from subway platforms to park plazas, and even in the pouring rain. Tos and Dominick DePrincipe were among those who got rained on."
"In her weekly therapy sessions, Julie revealed her most uncomfortable secrets: depression, debt, and childhood molestation. Her psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital would enter summaries of this information into Julie's computerized medical records. As a result, more than 200 pages of sensitive notes could be viewed by any doctor who had ever treated her on the shared medical network. Julie didn't know this until later, when a doctor mentioned the notes. Julie, a 43-year-old lawyer, initially felt uncomfortable and later became angry. ""These details are nobody's business,"" she said. But Shared Medical disagreed. Julie's psychiatrist would enter these secrets into her computerized medical records, making them available to any doctor who had treated her on the shared medical network. During Julie's therapy sessions, her psychiatrist would enter this information into her medical records, including her most unwillingly shared secrets, such as depression, financial difficulties, and childhood traumatic experiences. This information was entered into the shared medical network, resulting in more than 200 pages of sensitive information that could be viewed by any doctor who had treated Julie. Julie initially felt uncomfortable about this and later became angry, believing that this information should not be known to anyone, saying, ""These details are nobody's business."" But the shared medical company held a different opinion."
"To truly get the private sector involved in healthcare, there needs to be a significant increase in public sector investment to cover more of the population. The country got a new healthcare policy after 14 years. The long gap itself speaks to the priority, or lack thereof, given to an industry that requires immediate attention and is closely linked to the vision of rapid growth and emerging as a strong nation in the global order. The new policy proposed seven key transformations for healthcare institutions, including a shift from selective to comprehensive primary healthcare, which is popular and closely linked to referral hospitals. Additionally, the new policy also emphasizes the importance of preventive healthcare, public health, healthcare services, as well as health information technology and electronic health records in improving healthcare services."
"The CEO of Vodafone Hutchison Australia, Iñaki Berroeta, is attempting to temper expectations for Australia's impending 5G network, stating that while the company is progressing with its 5G rollout, he does not expect consumer devices to be available until the end of 2019. Berroeta declined to discuss VHA's spectrum ambitions in the Australian 5G space, instead emphasizing the need to establish a new ""ecosystem"" for mobile technology before operators begin spruiking products. He predicted that when 5G networks are launched, ""most markets"" will see devices become available within one to two months."
"A church in Skuorkil County is commemorating the late Father Walter Ciszek this weekend, a priest from Shenandoah who is currently being considered for sainthood. The Father Walter Ciszek Prayer League Center in Shenandoah will be bustling with activity this weekend. It is a museum showcasing Ciszek's life, a Jesuit missionary who went to the Soviet Union, was accused of being a Vatican spy, and was imprisoned until he was returned to the United States in 1963. He died in 1984 at the age of 80. ""We think Father Ciszek is a very special person who dedicated his life to God and the Church. His experience in the Soviet Union was very difficult, but he never gave up his faith. He is a true hero and a model worth learning from.""

The museum staff hopes that through these exhibitions, more people will learn about Father Ciszek's story and draw inspiration from his life."
"I was just reminded of why I abandoned my career in financial journalism 11 years ago, including my stint as a reporter on Wall Street. While the financial world has its fascinating aspects, I became disillusioned with the dominant narrative in the financial world, which seemed to be solely about money, without consideration for other factors such as values and social impact, which seemed to never be taken into account. Given the testosterone-filled trading floors and city executives who are almost completely disconnected from ordinary people, it's not entirely surprising."
"A report to be released on Tuesday will detail how an unidentified cyber hacker breached computers in South Carolina and stole tax returns of millions of residents over several years, according to NBC's Michael Isikoff.

"Syria: Why is Assad's power expanding? The presidential election held in early June announced that Assad won with 88.7% of the vote. Given the nature of this regime, this is not surprising. However, despite the fact that these elections are not ""free"" in any sense, and many people, as refugees living abroad, were unable to vote, the results suggest that the majority of the Syrian people still support Assad. Why is this? Stop the criminal attacks on Gaza! The Israeli military launched a ground attack on Gaza yesterday."

"BlackBerry Ltd. has decided not to renew a licensing agreement that allowed T-Mobile US Inc. to sell its products. A promotional misstep last month strained the relationship between BlackBerry and T-Mobile, despite their years of partnership. On Wednesday, BlackBerry announced that it would not renew the licensing agreement, which is set to expire on April 25. In February, T-Mobile offended the Canadian smartphone manufacturer by sending a message to its BlackBerry users, offering them an iPhone 5s with no upfront cost. The Seattle-based carrier later attempted to mend its relationship with BlackBerry through a second promotional offer, giving BlackBerry users a $200 credit when they traded in their old devices for any new T-Mobile phone. BlackBerry stated that this decision would not affect its partnerships with other carriers."
"On November 17, 2015, at 12:55 am, Michael Hoppen had to change the habits he had formed in Manhattan. We realized that in Manhattan, the cost was too high for us. We looked everywhere and finally came to this area, and found the houses to be stunning and felt great. The seller of the house we bought, Rodney and Desmond, lived next door. They received several offers, and I think they might have preferred us to be their neighbors - a couple expecting a child, wanting to buy their first home. I think this might have been more attractive than paying an extra 0.1% down payment."

"Washington — South Florida has long been one of the most intense battlegrounds in the country, with opponents employing tactics such as creating phantom candidates to siphon off votes from their rivals, or hiring so-called boleteras, or ballot brokers, to fill out hundreds of absentee ballots for elderly or disabled voters.

"I want to follow up on a viewer's question because we just started a lively discussion about how to save big bucks. Recently, on GMA Weekend and ABC News Now, I reported on how hiring a medical billing advocate can help you find and correct mistakes on your hospital bills, saving you thousands of dollars.

"Where America goes, Britain often follows, and this is particularly true of the negative aspects. If America experiences extreme weather, we usually follow suit a few days later. If America's violent crime rate rises, so does ours. And then there's the shopping frenzy. Britain is adopting traditional American events such as post-Christmas sales, bankrupting customers and refilling them with things they don't need. Black Friday has just passed, and today is Cyber Monday, with each shopping day becoming part of the retail calendar on both sides of the Atlantic."

"As a veteran of the climate change activist movement, I've grown accustomed to disappointment. So, when I was summoned to the office of Stanford University's Senior Vice Provost as the coordinator of Stanford's ""Fossil Free Stanford"" group, I attended the meeting with some trepidation. My concerns were well-founded. Earlier that morning, Harvard University had arrested a student for demanding a public debate on fossil fuel divestment. The previous fall, Brown University had flatly rejected student demands to divest from the thirteen dirtiest coal companies. Efforts to implement climate policy at the national and international levels hadn't fared much better."

Well, after reading a new report about Advanced Placement, I was interested in finding some hard data to help us better understand this issue. In addition to reporting on the participation of different racial and ethnic groups in Advanced Placement exams, the College Board's eighth ""AP Report to the Nation"" also includes the gender distribution for all exam subjects, based on data from the class of 2011 public school graduates.

"Don Draper: Who's crying now? Last month, when Jon Hamm hosted Saturday Night Live, his monologue told the story of his so-called career before Mad Men, including snippets of him in various roles - all of which looked and sounded like the quintessential, über-confident 1960s ad man Don Draper - including a QVC host and a Def Comedy Jam comedian.

"The airline operates 744 mainline aircraft, ranging in size from 50 to 366 seats. For a typical 737 jet with 179 passengers, the weight savings translates to about 11 pounds per flight. Dropping duty-free items like ""perfume, chocolates and liquor"" from sale on planes reportedly saves United Airlines 1.4 million gallons of fuel and $2.3 million annually. This implies that United earns less than $2.3 million in revenue from the sale of these items on planes, or that allowing passengers to buy them on the ground would not have a significant impact on its revenue."

"It's tax day: Remember the Procrastinators Club on Louisiana Avenue? Sometimes, a photo we come across in The Times-Picayune archives is so intriguing that it prompts a simple question: ""What is depicted in this New Orleans photo and what does 'Mums Alexander Merges' in the caption mean?""

"The controversy between the US intelligence agencies and their elected President Donald Trump is not only confusing but also a special case for evaluating the principles that should govern the relationship between national intelligence and political administration under a democratic system. In theory, an intelligence-based national security system is responsible for detecting and tracking any national security threats, whether external or internal, and is committed to eliminating them. However, it operates under the authorization of an elected political administration, which is the highest sovereign authority. Under a democratic system, the political administration is the ultimate embodiment and representative of national sovereignty. Therefore, the relationship between the national security system and the political administration is complex and subtle, requiring a balance to be struck to ensure that the national security system can effectively fulfill its duties while also being subject to the supervision and restraint of the political administration. This balance is crucial to ensuring the effectiveness of the national security system and the healthy operation of the democratic system. The controversy between the US intelligence agencies and President Trump highlights the importance of this balance and the complexity of the relationship between the national security system and the political administration under a democratic system."

Today's Malawi will not tolerate such nonsense. A few weeks ago, when your party was terrorizing the whole nation, your president Peter Mutharika was silent. As the pressure mounted, the president instructed Mgomezulu Kalirani to draft a statement, but it did not address the issues that the nation expected. So far, your government has not revealed the identities of the terrorists nor has it brought them to justice."

"When the economy starts to stagnate, Bernanke's war on savers continues. Some of these funds can even offer substantial double-digit returns, such as the 20% return my Permanent Wealth Investor subscribers got from one fund over two years. Dividend capture funds: These funds buy shares in companies before they pay dividends, and then sell the stocks after the dividend is paid.

I had expected to see sympathy and compassion, but as I read the comments, my heart sank. They were filled with cruelty."

When I asked her why this was a bad thing, she said that international exchange students often think Americans are stupid unless they prove otherwise. They think Americans don't travel as widely as they do, aren't as fluent in foreign languages, and aren't as knowledgeable about world cultures. I said what any good American would say: why don't they just stay home? Oh, she replied, it's not that they think our universities are stupid."

"Ricky Karlgaard: You should focus on four areas. One is financial regulation, which still makes it hard for small businesses to get loans. You mentioned healthcare regulation, Obamacare has increased the cost burden in many ways. Then there's environmental regulation, which is a broad area that is strangling small businesses, especially in California where I live. Farmers in California are being crushed, supposedly to protect certain insects. And then you have labor regulation. Last year, we saw the National Labor Relations Board take action against Boeing."

Opponents of tithing believe it is a misinterpretation of the Bible, a human creation rather than God's will. They think there should be freedom to choose the amount to donate, and are arguing with pastors, writing letters, and even protesting by leaving the church. In response, some pastors are changing their teachings, abandoning the most popular fundraising method of the past few decades."

Currently, New Jersey law classifies drunk driving as a traffic offense, with a typical bail of $2,500. The classification as a traffic offense allows drivers charged with drunk driving to continue driving while they await their court date.

Instead, A3057 would increase penalties for individuals who are convicted of drunk driving two or more times within 60 days, designating it as a fourth-degree crime."

"The Bible teaches us to ""resist the devil and he will flee from you"" (James 4:7), and also tells us to stay away from those who are controlled by all kinds of evil desires (see 1 Timothy 3:5-6). In God's eyes, many great leaders have fallen into the temptations of the flesh, possibly ruining their lives and ministries. Someone said, ""It takes a lifetime to build a good reputation, but only a minute to lose it."" This is a true statement! I believe one of the main reasons leaders fall is that most of them have never consciously built a firewall in their minds and emotions."

"The band Led Zeppelin plagiarized from the 1960s band Spirit? Did The Voice plagiarize from American Idol? In a recent lawsuit, the heirs of the composer of the song ""Taurus"" claimed that ""Stairway to Heaven"" infringed on copyright law. Creators have been borrowing from each other for centuries. But what is the real harm - economic, artistic, or otherwise? How much of the original work is transplanted into the new work? It's always a gray area. Music copyright lawsuits have been going on for over a century."
"A detailed upgrade process, I hope that if you have no such experience before, this will be helpful to you. Let me be in charge of removing the screws at the back, being careful that the keyboard slides and connects to the blue connector, and gently taking it off. Remove the back again, start removing the screws, and take out the bracket. Now start replacing the solid-state drive. Great, the solid-state drive matches the slot perfectly. Tighten the screws to secure the solid-state drive. Evaluate the performance of the solid-state drive, it surprises me again, scoring 7.8. As far as I know, the highest score is 7.9."

"The rally racing video shot by Ken Block is extremely stunning. However, the New South Wales police did not want Ken Block to shoot this particular rally racing video - the video you see above - in Sydney. The Hoonigan team turned to New York, giving up on Australia. Here is the video they shot - a video that could have been shot with the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Opera House, and our most iconic landmarks as the background. The shooting of Ken Block's Gymkhana Nine was to coincide with the release of the video game Forza Horizon 3, which is set in Australia - so it made sense to shoot Gymkhana Nine in Australia."

"The photograph of Yemen we published is one of the most disturbing we have ever printed. Here's why we decided to publish these images. In our recent coverage of Yemen, a 7-year-old Yemeni girl, Amal Hussein, appeared before us, her gaze shocking, a country on the brink of war and famine. Amal's body was like a skeleton, her head tilted to one side, as if she couldn't look directly at the person in front of her. Some readers may have had the same impulse to look away."

Mnuchin's attempt to alleviate growing uncertainty on Capitol Hill comes as President Trump escalates the trade war with China."
"January 29, 2015: Following the money flow. One of the reasons for the progress in the new peace talks is that the factions controlling most of the population are willing to make concessions to help stop the rapid decline in the standard of living across the country. If the decline can be stopped, the factions are willing to make concessions. The fighting between factions, especially between the two governments claiming to rule the whole country, has led to a withering of economic activity and an increase in shortages. Then, there is the violence of Islamic terrorism. While most Libyans are grateful for the help Islamic terrorists provided in overthrowing Kaddafi in 2011, since then these groups have become a greater plague than Kaddafi's secret police."
"The fundamental difference between humans and machines lies in two key aspects: creativity and empathy. Regardless of how advanced artificial intelligence becomes, these two aspects are the reasons why agency services will continue to exist and why marketers will remain busy in the coming years. The purpose of AI is to be a supplement to your work, enhancing your capabilities. AI can bring high efficiency to companies that they previously lacked, and give them more time to complete those incremental tasks. Agency companies were successful in the past because they were creative."

In 2003, former President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva launched the ""Zero Hunger"" plan, which is believed to have lifted 30 to 40 million Brazilians out of poverty.

This practice not only supported local small farmers but also provided high-quality nutrition to children from low-income families. The plan also provided cash transfers and vocational training to poor families, further improving their standard of living. Through these measures, the ""Zero Hunger"" plan achieved significant results in reducing poverty in Brazil."

"The head of the United Nations fact-finding mission on the Gaza conflict, Judge Richard Goldstone, urged the international community to take action to end the impunity of Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory for violations of international law as he presented the mission's report to the Human Rights Council.

"The Minister of Minor Affairs of North Korea's main task was to refute every statement ever made by a French intellectual. In one particular year, he took aim at Jean-Paul Sartre, first countering Sartre's assertion that ""three o'clock is always too early or too late for anything you want to do"". Since it was a leisurely Friday afternoon, the Minister of Minor Affairs simply made a phone call and named his local soccer team the ""4:25 PM Sports Club"". This made Sartre look absurd, as all of the team's games started at 4:25 PM. In fact, whenever they played, their fans would chant ""Sartre, are you watching?"""
