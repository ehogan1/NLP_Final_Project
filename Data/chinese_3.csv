"Cases of voter fraud have been confirmed in multiple states, including Mississippi. The top election official in Louisiana warned residents about potential scams involving sensitive information targeting potential voters, concerns that have arisen in multiple other states beforehand. The scam involves a phone caller claiming to work for a voter registration assistance organization. According to Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin, the caller offers to register residents over the phone and, in some cases, sends absentee ballots to voters. Under state law, residents cannot register to vote or request an absentee ballot over the phone."
"For small businesses that operate on credit, accounts receivable make up a large proportion of the balance sheet. During the annual audit, the auditor will verify that your claims about the accounts receivable balance have sufficient evidence. These claims are called assertions. The most common audit procedure for accounts receivable is confirmation, in which the auditor will ask your customers to confirm their account balances. Understanding which assertions can be verified through confirmation can help you understand why your auditor may need to perform multiple audit procedures on the same account. Accounts receivable confirmation is primarily used to verify the existence assertion."
"It's great not to be Jim Furyk today. 1. The U.S. team entered Sunday's matches with a four-point lead in the Ryder Cup, and the home crowd was expecting another dominant day. 2. Luke Donald beat Bubba Watson in the first match of the day to make the score 10-7, but the U.S. still maintained a strong lead. Whatever. 3. Europe's Paul Lawrie thoroughly defeated Brandt Snedeker to add another point for Europe. 4. At least Keegan Bradley, the best U.S. player all weekend, was able to go head-to-head with Rory McIlroy."
"This kind of thing happens all the time: you hit the snooze button on your alarm once, twice, or even three times, so by the time you finally get washed, dressed, and ready to face the day, you're already running behind schedule. Typically, this results in you skipping breakfast altogether. It turns out that your breakfast habits are a time-saving technique that should not be ignored. Firstly, research shows that eating a nutritious, high-protein, and balanced breakfast every morning is an effective way to activate your brain, improve focus, and boost performance. Additionally, eating breakfast is also associated with better weight control, as it provides energy for the body and may reduce hunger later in the day."
"Dublin: Lawmakers voted overwhelmingly on Friday to pass Ireland's first abortion bill, which allows for the termination of pregnancies under certain circumstances when a woman's life is at risk, marking a significant step for the predominantly Catholic country in loosening its strict ban on abortion. Exhausted lawmakers applauded the 127-31 result on Friday, while abortion rights activists cheered outside the parliament gates as they watched the result on their phones. The vote ended a grueling debate that began on Wednesday morning, had a brief recess at 5am on Thursday, and didn't conclude until midnight on Friday.

"The best Halloween costume ideas are inspired by the most unforgettable moments of the year, and 2016 was undoubtedly a year to remember. We witnessed the Summer Olympics and the US Presidential Election, two events that dominate headlines (and Facebook timelines!) every four years. Add to that Beyoncé's visual album masterpiece, the Pokémon Go phenomenon, and the colorful, quotable chaos of Suicide Squad, and 2016 was basically begging for a Halloween costume extravaganza. We've become Halloween experts - creating over 1 billion pages of Halloween content. This is our time to shine."

"VOLGOGRAD, Russia (Reuters) - Iceland will attempt to defy the sweltering heat of Volgograd on Friday when they take on Nigeria in their second World Cup match, after impressively holding two-time champions Argentina to a draw. The World Cup newcomers, who are dreaming of advancing to the knockout stage and writing a new chapter in one of the greatest stories in international football in recent years, will try to do so. However, standing in their way is not only Nigeria, who are desperate for a win after losing 0-2 to Croatia in their opening match, but also the challenge posed by the scorching heat of Volgograd, a city in southern Russia. They will have to face not only the Nigerian team but also the test of the high temperatures in Volgograd."
"A pair of thieves from the Greater Vancouver area have been arrested and charged in connection with a long-standing mail and identity theft. According to an RCMP news release issued in Courtenay on November 11, the Courtenay RCMP and Canada Post investigators worked together in the theft investigation to identify and arrest the main suspect, and obtained a large amount of evidence through search warrants.

"We first looked at which major brands had the most expensive maintenance costs over the first 10 years of driving. We grouped all models by brand and year to calculate the average cost per brand. To estimate the annual maintenance cost, we found the cost of maintenance every other oil change (since oil changes are typically done every six months). Without a doubt, German imports led the pack by a wide margin. Toyota and its two brands, Lexus and Subaru, were one of the cheapest brands, with owners saving at least $10,000 in maintenance costs over 10 years compared to BMW."
"Aurora, Illinois - A suburban boy died after a tragic accident in a high school parking lot.

"Veteran Congressman Jim Leach, a Republican from Iowa, lost his seat in the 2006 election. I'm not defending the ""moderate Republican,"" but it's worth mentioning! In my opinion, Leach was absolutely the best Republican in the House. However, one can only be glad about his defeat. The fact that this happened only shows how bad the entire Republican Party has become. Leach was a person with genuinely good instincts and some basically correct ideas about how the US should conduct itself in the world, but he was useless in practice."
"Trump's tweets have long raised questions about whether they violate Twitter's anti-harassment rules. On Monday, after Trump tweeted that North Korea may ""not be around much longer"", Twitter was forced to explain why it hadn't banned the president from the service. Twitter's public policy account posted a series of six tweets in which the company said it considers ""newsworthiness"" and ""public interest"" when determining whether a user has violated its rules. Twitter said these considerations have long been used internally to decide the fate of problematic accounts. The company stated that its rules are designed to ensure all users can use the service safely, but also considers whether certain tweets have news value or serve the public interest. In this case, Twitter deemed Trump's tweets, although controversial, to be of news value and in the public interest, and therefore took no action."
"No one can accurately predict when the stock market will end its record-breaking bull run, but the best way for investors to prepare for the next economic downturn is to remain calm and stick to a prudently devised plan. The Star spoke with Ashley Feinstein Gerstley, author of The 30-Day Money Cleanse: Take control of your finances, manage your spending, and get rid of financial stress for good, to ask why people struggle so much with money — and how they can do better. People also often overlook or inadvertently misreport other common expenses."

"South Bend, Indiana -- The Irish took to the practice field for the final time on Thursday morning before the Blue Gold game on Saturday. One of the biggest questions the team faced when spring practice began still doesn't have an answer: who will emerge at the outside linebacker position? Defensive coordinator Clark Lea said fifth-year outside linebacker Asmar Bilal is currently the closest to being ""solid"" in the unit, but he seems content with the uncertainty. He believes the position has made huge strides over the past month and a half, but with several months still to go before Week 1, he's in no rush to have everything settled. Despite not having made a decision at the position, Lea is pleased with the progress the team has made and is confident they'll find the right guy over the next few months."

He talked about the early days of his career, and also addressed rumors of being a culture vulture for borrowing from British and Caribbean culture.

"It's difficult to exaggerate Amazon's success and its growing influence. Amazon's market value is hovering around $1 trillion. Their growth rate is astonishing. According to most estimates, Amazon currently accounts for nearly 50% of e-commerce sales in the US, about 5% of all retail sales, and is larger than the combined total of its next 10 biggest competitors. Research has found that about 55% of online product searches start on Amazon.

While people should be able to express themselves freely, they should do so in a calm and respectful manner. The video does not show the real me, and I am not a racist."

Some of the widgets are cool, some are funny... and some are just weird. It's worth noting that some of the widgets can only be accessed by upgrading to the pro version, which costs $1.26, or the equivalent in local currency."

"[Author: Jonathan Stalin] We often see and hear the two major parties engaging in many unnecessary arguments during debates, a phenomenon that seems to be more pronounced during election campaigns. However, it is rare to see the two major parties proactively seeking to discuss real trash issues. I mean real trash!

"The town of Narra is being plagued by a terror incident instigated by residents of Bataraza, Palawan, which is not the work of extremists, but of politicians. Local residents are calling on the government to help prevent another attack on their island community, with one resident claiming that the attack was due to their refusal to support the re-election of incumbent Mayor Anton Burahan. Bidding Jubail, a 60-year-old resident of Bataraza, said ""we were helpless"" as he recalled the January 2 attack on the island town, allegedly by Burahan's supporters who used an M203 grenade launcher and M-14 and M-16 rifles. The residents blame the attack on their refusal to support Burahan's re-election bid."
"German business confidence plunged to its lowest level in two and a half years in October, marking a sixth consecutive month of decline, eliminating any doubts that Europe's largest economy is being affected by the euro zone debt crisis. The Ifo institute, a think tank based in Munich, said on Wednesday that its business climate index, based on a monthly survey of more than 7,000 companies, fell to 100.0 in October from 101.4 in September. ""The shadows over the German economy are growing darker,"" said Hans-Werner Sinn, president of the Ifo institute.

"The life of the mind has always been a mystery to poets and neuroscientists who try to map and mark it, whereas for me it's about finding it. In Irish tradition, thinking itself is something to think about, and so there are many concepts in the Irish language that involve the mind, dreams, and imagination. As a student, many nuances are still unclear to me, but language is about conversation. I would love to hear more mature insights from native Irish speakers about words related to thinking in Irish."
"According to analysts, the market has entered a consolidation phase after the recent rebound.

"Los Angeles - A proposal to grant subpoena power to the oversight committee that oversees the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department was originally set to be decided by voters in March 2020. The proposal failed to gain approval from the oversight committee today. Supporters of the ""Reform LA Jails"" initiative collected nearly 250,000 signatures in support of the measure, which also requires the civilian oversight committee to study ways to reduce the county jail population and divert jail construction funds to alternative incarceration methods. Supervisor Sheila Kuehl said the issue should be decided by the more than 10 million residents of the county. The Board of Supervisors failed to approve the proposal, so it will be decided by voters. Supporters of the initiative collected enough signatures to put the issue before voters. However, the proposal did not actually pass in the Board of Supervisors, but will be decided by voters through the ballot.

Cuomo has two Twitter accounts, one with 853,000 followers and another with 10,400 followers.

"Two years ago, I was sitting in a South Atlantic League baseball game (Low A) watching the Hagerstown Suns host the visiting Greensboro Grasshoppers. Behind me, two Greensboro pitchers, Trevor Richards and Ben Meyer, were charting the game. As I mentioned in this article, neither of the two pitchers seemed to be on the radar of Major League teams. Richards went undrafted out of a small college in 2015, so he had to start his professional career with the Gateway Grizzlies of the independent Frontier League. After a stellar 2016 with Greensboro, he was signed by the Miami Marlins."
"The United Nations, August 26 -- As media predictions of a possible US missile strike on Syria continue to grow, one can't help but ask: will the US still launch a strike even if the UN investigative team is still in Syria, and even if they find something in the suburbs of Damascus? The question is: regarding Syria, British and US officials have stated that the current investigation may be in vain, as Damascus has had time to destroy some of the evidence. What does the UN hope to achieve through this investigation? What actions is the UN willing to take?"

"Without a doubt, the addiction drama film ""Beautiful Boy"" - not the horror film ""Halloween"" - is the most terrifying film of the week. Starring Steve Carell and Timothée Chalamet, the movie portrays in a haunting and unsettling way a young man's descent into methamphetamine addiction (as well as heroin, pills, and marijuana), and the efforts of a devoted father to save him. It's a true and terrifying story that even mediocre direction and clichéd writing can't diminish its impact."

"Recent research has shown that patients with dementia can benefit greatly from art therapy. While many people believe that a healthy diet and exercise are key to healthy aging, the International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry found that certain personality traits can also have a huge impact on your life after aging. We all lead busy lives, but if you have recently moved into an assisted living house or a memory care cottage, it is even more important to stay in touch with your loved ones. Nutrition is important for everyone, but it is especially crucial for the elderly."

"Nothing brings people together like ratings and an impending contract negotiation. In a meeting in Midtown Manhattan, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination and the queen of prime-time news put aside their differences. Donald Trump and Megyn Kelly, who had been openly at odds, or secretly seething, or coldly cordial, met on Monday at Trump Tower, apparently ending their cold war.

According to Simpson, the roads become busier in the summer because young drivers are more frequently on the roads since they are no longer in school. Simpson said, ""The kids are out of school on summer break or college students are home on summer break, so you're going to see more young drivers on the road, going to events or going to work, they're not spending 6-7 hours a day in school."""

Murphy has a complicated history in the role, simultaneously drawing a paycheck from a nonprofit that serves agency employees and the corrections department's retirement fund."
"As Californians, as people with a voice, we should know what it means to displace people from their land. In the 1950s and 60s, California funded expeditions every year to remove all Native Americans from the entire area. But this is not just a historical phenomenon: on the West Bank, Israeli settlers and the Israeli government have been trying for decades to erase the small Palestinian village of Susya, which has existed near Hebron since at least the 19th century. In the 1980s, it was declared an archaeological site in order to allow settlers to move in and replace the previous inhabitants."

"A cancer expert has discovered a way to kill tumors using light in just two hours. The technique involves injecting a chemical compound and then exposing it to ultraviolet light. In laboratory mice, it was found that cancer cells self-destructed, with up to 95% of cancer cells dying within two hours. Professor Matthew Gdovin revealed that the cancer cells he injected with the compound nitrobenzaldehyde became too acidic to survive. After applying for a patent for the ""photodynamic"" treatment, he said: ""There are many different types of cancer, but they all share the property of being susceptible to this induced cell suicide."""
"Recently, drones have appeared in various shapes and sizes, but generally speaking, most drones still belong to one of two categories. One is the multi-rotor type (quadcopters, hexacopters, octocopters, etc.), and the other is the fixed-wing type. Both types of drones have their advantages and disadvantages. Multi-rotor drones are generally more stable and easier to fly, but much slower than fixed-wing drones that focus on accelerating forward. On the other hand, fixed-wing drones can fly faster and farther than their hovering counterparts, but are more difficult to operate because they cannot take off and land vertically."

The resistant variant also tends to produce only mild symptoms, just like the widely spread strain. The 13 cases were scattered across the globe, including in Europe, the United States, and Asia."
"Russian President Vladimir Putin described Turkey's downing of a Russian warplane as a ""stab in the back by accomplices of terrorism"" and said the incident would have serious consequences. Before meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah on Tuesday, Putin said in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi that the downed plane was attacked in Syrian airspace, just 1 kilometer from the Turkish border, and crashed 4 kilometers inside Syria. This contradicts Turkey's claim that the plane was warned multiple times before being shot down for violating Turkish airspace."
"Arsene Wenger believes that the recovery of England forward Theo Walcott, combined with the impending return of German international Lukas Podolski, means that Arsenal do not need to feel extra pressure to buy another striker in January. The Gunners will resume domestic action on Saturday, hoping to bounce back by beating third-placed Southampton to maintain their position at the top of the Barclays Premier League. Walcott will face his former club after two months out following abdominal surgery. Meanwhile, Podolski, who has been out since August 27 with a hamstring injury, is expected to return by the end of December. The Gunners are hoping the return of Walcott and Podolski will help them maintain their position at the top of the league."
"The New York Knicks have completed a quarter of their schedule with a mediocre 9-9 record, aiming to end their 43-year championship drought. Coach Jeff Hornacek and the Knicks will have an advantage in December as they face their opponents. The month will feature 15 games, with only five against teams with a winning percentage over 50%. They will host the 5-13 Minnesota Timberwolves at home on Friday. Joakim Noah, Derrick Rose, and Carmelo Anthony are undoubtedly the biggest stars on the team, but their performance has yet to meet expectations. Anthony's team-leading average of 22.2 points is slightly higher than last season. Hornacek and the Knicks hope to achieve more wins in December, laying the foundation for the team's playoff journey."
"The Hashim bookstore was always a beacon of knowledge and a destination for readers and intellectuals until the year 2000, when the number of visitors began to decline due to the difficult economic situation in the Gaza Strip.

However, the rise of the internet and the poverty of the residents of the Gaza Strip stifled these activities. ""Due to the rise of the internet and the economic stagnation, we are no longer able to obtain books for distribution or sale."""
"Google's relationship with China has long been tense, and after accusing the Chinese government of backing hackers who attacked the company's systems and employees, the search giant essentially pulled out of the country.

"Ray Trew has resigned as chairman of Notts County Football Club and announced that the League Two club has been sold. Trew became the owner and chairman of the club in 2010, but he said he made the decision due to his family recently suffering ""vile and mindless abuse"". Notts County currently sits 16th in League Two, having been relegated last year, and appointed Jamie Fullarton as the new manager in January. According to BBC Radio Nottingham, local businessman Alan Hardy is in negotiations with the club to purchase it.

"To end the war on whistleblowers, the Espionage Act needs reform. Over the past 100 years, the law has evolved into a tool for government secrecy. The evolution of the Espionage Act has had a profound impact on the freedom of political debate in modern America. Initially, the law was a vague decree that granted President Woodrow Wilson the power to imprison critics and censor media during World War I. Today, it has transformed into a powerful law that regulates political discourse by controlling secrets rather than speech. Censorship did not stop with the end of the war, it has evolved. Despite its name, the Espionage Act has always been a broad decree."

The UK belongs to the EU - and is stronger in the European community."
"As Conservative leader William Hague made his way through a crowd of loyal supporters to lunch on Tuesday, the host introduced him as the ""next prime minister"", prompting sudden laughter, even from many of his own supporters.

Ladbrokes, Britain's largest betting company, has stopped taking bets on Thursday's election and has begun paying out on a Labour victory."

"From the M1917 to the M1A2, American tanks have dominated the battlefield. The US Army and Marine Corps are approaching a century-long milestone – the 100th anniversary of American tank service. This animated GIF, created by the staff of partcatalog.com, shows the evolution of American tanks, from the creaky M1917 light tank to the M1A2 Abrams tank, demonstrating how the US went from being a novice in the world of tanks to a world leader. For example, the M1917 light tank was simply a copy of the Renault FT-17. Such engineering plagiarism is unimaginable today. Over the past 100 years, the US Army and Marine Corps have made tremendous progress, driving the development of tank technology and making the US the world's leading tank manufacturer."
"Among these groups, the most notable name is Bajrang Dal, whose radicals burned alive an Australian missionary, Graham Staines, and his two minor sons in Orissa in 1999. This heartbreaking incident is often cited as one of the early examples of ""saffron terror"" in India. The ugly face of Hindu terrorism has once again come to the forefront with the arrest of three people by the Maharashtra police for their alleged involvement in ""terror activities"" in the state. According to the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), the police recovered 22 items from the residence of the accused in Pune. The phenomenon of Hindu terrorism has once again come into focus."
"Ron Brown and AAG Archaeology discovered a rare example of a North Eastern grid door. Below is a drawing of a Tyneside grid door. A lavatory door from a historic building in South Tyneside has become one of the North East's most unlikely tourist attractions. During an investigation of a Regency terraced house on South Shields' Sea Road, staff from AAG Archaeology discovered what is believed to be the only lavatory door to enter a museum collection. It was found by the sharp-eyed archaeologist Ron Brown, who is thought to have uncovered one of the most complete examples of a classic North Eastern grid door, which emerged from the ruins of a demolished lavatory."
"M. Night Shyamalan's 2017 horror film Split, the most exciting part was the ending, which was also one of the few things the movie got right. The character of David Dunn, played by Bruce Willis in Unbreakable, appeared in a brief and surprising scene at the end, creating a shared universe that Shyamalan was eager to capitalize on. However, there is a huge gap between giving fans a brief cameo and building a story around it. As the third installment of the trilogy, Glass looks like a messy amalgam of half-baked ideas, forming an unbalanced chaos."

"Sign the RootsAction petition telling mayors and police chiefs across the country that you support the right to peaceful protest unimpeded. The Occupy Wall Street protesters won a major victory on Friday when New York Mayor Bloomberg and Brookfield Properties, the owner of the Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan, backed down from their demands that protesters temporarily leave the park for cleaning and comply with new rules that would have banned sleeping bags, many types of equipment, and even lying down in the park.

"Senior technology executives discussed the impact of automation technology on their organizations. For many organizations and employees, technological automation is both an opportunity and a threat. On the one hand, the use of robotic process automation and other tools can improve efficiency by automating manual and repetitive tasks. On the other hand, it has the potential to make jobs redundant. Recently, technology executives gathered at roundtable meetings in Sydney and Melbourne to discuss the impact of automation technology on their organizations. One of the key issues was how to ensure compliance with management policies and procedures when ""robots"" replace humans in executing tasks across the business. Other issues discussed included how to manage the changes brought about by automation technology and how to ensure that employees are able to adapt to new technologies and new ways of working.

"Edgar Wright has never made a bad film, he has never even made a mediocre one. It is therefore understandable that Wright has so far avoided making direct sequels throughout his career. However, this may be about to change with the arrival of Baby Driver. When Shaun of the Dead was a success, Wright, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost did not capitalize on the film's success by making a zombie sequel, instead opting to collaborate with Pegg and Frost on a thematically related trilogy - the ""Cornetto Trilogy"", which also includes the equally excellent Hot Fuzz and The World's End."

"I first heard these verses in a small chapel in Kiev, Ukraine. I remember the day, because it was a Sunday morning, the day the news of Princess Diana's death was being reported. I had just left my job on Wall Street and was living with my mother in Kiev, because my father had passed away, and I was there because I felt lost and without direction. I recall sitting in the back of the room, surrounded by wooden walls, feeling a bit self-conscious amidst the fervent preaching of my foreign companions. But when I heard these verses, my thoughts were drawn back in."

"Guess what, the NBA is actually an entertainment show. It's just that super producer David Stern is no longer behind the scenes manipulating everything (or else the New York team would somehow win the lottery). Instead, the league stumbles forward like an over-budget, out-of-control Hollywood blockbuster - driven by the egos of its star players, filled with jaw-dropping plot twists, and suffering from endless rewrites. It gets worse: we haven't even mentioned the Los Angeles Lakers yet. Unfortunately, the biggest news so far this season has nothing to do with basketball."
"Doug Newcomb 2015 Lincoln MKC If you're looking for a stylish and relatively affordable luxury crossover that's an alternative to the usual imports, the 2015 Lincoln MKC is an attractive option. Relatively affordable. Wide range of driver-assist options. Quiet ride. Outdated infotainment interface. Less engine power than some competitors. If you're looking for a stylish and relatively affordable luxury crossover that's an alternative to the usual imports, the 2015 Lincoln MKC is an attractive option. While Ford has been setting sales records and earning profits, its luxury brand Lincoln has been lagging behind its competitors."
"The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) plans to put a small robot into a volcano in Hawaii to collect data and geographical features such as fissures and volcanic vents to map the interior of the volcano. Currently, a similar robot is already exploring the volcano. Dr. Carolyn Parcheta from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said: ""We don't fully understand how volcanoes erupt, we have some models, but they are all very, very simplified. The goal of this project is to help make these models more realistic."" According to NASA, the robot developed by NASA can crawl into areas that humans cannot enter."
"Hearst Magazines will be busy in 2018, completing its acquisition of Rodale, buying some magazines in the Netherlands, and increasing the frequency of its two newest titles. Pioneer Woman, a joint venture between Hearst Magazines and blogger, Food Network star Ree Drummond, published two best-selling issues in 2017 and will increase its frequency to four issues in 2018. In his annual year-end memo to staff, Hearst Magazines President David Carey noted that now is a good time to be in the magazine business, citing the failed attempt by Airbnb to launch its own magazine, Pineapple, in 2014, which only published one issue. Hearst Magazines will also complete its acquisition of Rodale and buy some magazines in the Netherlands in 2018, moves that signal the company's confidence in the magazine business."
"Activists insist that future meetings in the central area of Dundee should include discussions on accessibility for the disabled. However, what was supposed to be a pleasant Turkish dessert experience turned into a bittersweet experience brought about by the chaos caused by St Johnstone's draw in the UEFA Cup. A nursery in Dundee failed to increase its childcare places. Dundee inventor John Cruickshank died at the age of 84. What started as an act of defiance quickly spread globally. Angus Council ordered a retired couple from Montrose to remove all bird feeders from their front yard."
"The daughter of Kannada tabloid editor today claimed that her father was ""innocent"" and would come out ""safe"" from the case. Her father was arrested for allegedly hiring a hitman to kill his colleague journalist. Ravi Belagere, the publisher of 'Hi Bangalore', was arrested from his residence yesterday for allegedly hiring a 'supari' killer from Vijayapura in northern Karnataka to kill Sunil Heggaravalli. ""In this case, no one has filed the first information report based on someone's complaint, it is a case registered by the police on their own based on the statement of the killer."
"Manatees are large, gray, aquatic mammals. They have full figures - I'm sure clothing companies would try to say that manatees are ""voluptuous"" in an attempt to convince them to buy plus-sized jeans - that taper into a flat, paddle-like tail. Adult manatees are typically about 10 feet long and weigh between 800 and 1,200 pounds. Manatees are one of the ugliest sea creatures God created, and there are a lot of weird ones in the ocean. These are facts learned from the ""Save the Manatee Club"" website - interestingly, the observation of ugliness is subjective, but it's obvious enough to be considered a fact."
"Arcade games are no longer just for kids. Some top online casinos now offer arcade games that can be played with real money. But the latest and most exciting way to play real money arcade games is by using an Apple iPhone. Playing iPhone arcade games is fun and easy. Players just need to sign up at an online iPhone casino and then can find links to play various iPhone casino games, including some arcade-style games.

"French woman Isabelle Dinoire, who underwent the world's first face transplant, showed off her new look to the public on Monday. Speaking in a slurred voice, she said she now looks ""like anyone else"" and hopes to resume a normal life. Isabelle's pronunciation was difficult to understand, but she explained how she was attacked by a dog last year and thanked the family of the donor who gave her new lips, chin, and nose. In the 15-hour operation on November 27 in Amiens, doctors grafted facial tissue onto her face, which still bears a small circular scar."
"Did Donald Trump release his own tax returns? For a moment, it seemed like Rachel Maddow had a genuine scoop. Then, suddenly, it turned out that... thanks to MSNBC in the US, the claim that Trump ""paid no taxes for 18 years"" was proven to be false. Moreover, Trump's tax rate in 2005 seemed to be higher than that of most politicians, and his income was quite substantial. However, we cannot determine whether this report was selectively extracted."
"Pleasant Mount, Lackawanna County - School officials are requiring students who haven't received the latest vaccine to stay home for several weeks as St. Peter's County deals with a mumps outbreak. According to Dr. Sam Ray, superintendent of the North St. Peter School District, there are two confirmed cases of mumps in St. Peter's County, one of which is a student in the school district, he said. Another potential case of mumps is awaiting test results from health officials, Ray said. Ray did not specify which school the student with mumps attends, but said North St. Peter High School is ""involved"" in the outbreak."
"During difficult times, creative bakers turned to desperation pies: vinegar pie and green tomato pie, which are typically not on America's list of favorite sweet treats. Nevertheless, these and other desperation pies still exist today, showcasing the resourcefulness of home cooks during the Great Depression. Some desperation pies, such as green tomato pie, still have a loyal following today. Imagine being a thrifty farmer during the Great Depression, wanting to make a dessert for your family, but traditional pie ingredients, such as cherries or pecans, are too expensive or unavailable."
"There is a Speed Graphic camera here, which used to be a standard piece of equipment in newsrooms all over the country. You may have seen them in movies from the 1930s and 1940s, with groups of photographers wearing press passes on the hatbands of their fedoras. The Speed Graphic was a huge, heavy camera that required flashbulbs as big as light bulbs to take pictures at night, and it was the first professional camera I used for my high school yearbook and a part-time job on a newspaper during high school and college. I have a Speed Graphic in the office that uses sheet film - you take a picture, then pull out the slide and load another one."
"Anyone who has ever been frustrated with shooting video in low-light conditions will be excited about Canon's strange and amazing new camera, which can shoot full HD color video in almost complete darkness. The ""multipurpose"" camera, called the MH20F-SH, has a 2.26 megapixel full-frame sensor. The lower resolution is due to the fact that each pixel is extremely large - precisely 19 micrometers, which is 7.5 times the size of the pixels on Canon's flagship DSLR, the 1Dx."
"Is our efficient tax authority stifling the country? I have never seen the central bank release a report urging the government to cut taxes. But the fact is that it partly explains why the economy is going downhill. In fact, as can be seen from this rare historical data, the tax commissioner Chris Jordan and his team have done a great job in cracking down on corporate over-claiming. With the increase in productivity brought about by computer technology, the government's tax revenue has risen sharply."
"Facilities managers wear many hats, and it is not uncommon for a facilities manager to lead meetings, provide plumbing advice, suggest decorating ideas, and ensure the floors are properly cleaned all in one day. In considering facilities operations, facilities managers consider the safety and well-being of all building occupants. To be a successful facilities manager, one must have a strong management background, technical skills, a basic knowledge of architecture, and knowledge of technical aspects. Facilities managers are responsible for the supervision of the physical facilities of a building or building complex."
"A professor of communication at Texas A&M University wanted to understand the impact of changes in the newspaper industry on politics in our country, so she conducted some research and published it in the Journal of Communication. If you've noticed that political polarization seems to have increased significantly over the past few years, you're not imagining things. Johanna Dunaway of Colorado State University and Louisiana State University, and her colleagues, found that this polarization occurred nationwide during a period when the number of local newspapers and journalists was decreasing. As Johanna Dunaway and her colleagues found, during a period when the number of local newspapers and journalists was decreasing nationwide, political polarization also increased."
"Washington -- At the center of a nationwide Salmonella outbreak, an Iowa egg producer apologized on Wednesday before a congressional subcommittee and acknowledged that his family's operation had ""gotten too big"" before it started adopting some of the necessary complex procedures to ensure it met all government requirements. ""What I mean is, we got big, and then we started putting in place some of the necessary complex procedures to make sure we met all of the government requirements,"" egg producer Austin J. DeCoster testified before the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee. He is the founder of DeCoster Egg Farms, an empire that over the past three decades has been linked to multiple deadly Salmonella outbreaks in several states. DeCoster's company is believed to be at the center of the recent Salmonella outbreak."
"The Conservative candidate was disqualified for not disclosing his drink-driving conviction, for which he was later found guilty. Ben Wong, 48, who owns a takeaway called New Dragon Palace in Silver Street, had been standing for the Conservatives in the Victoria ward by-election on May 2, but was disqualified after being found guilty. The deadline for nominations had already passed on April 3, but he appeared at Yeovil Magistrates' Court on March 21 without notifying local Somerset Conservatives."
"Battfleck is officially no more! Ben Affleck has formally stepped down from his role as Bruce Wayne in The Batman, passing the torch to a new, yet-to-be-chosen actor. Warner Bros. had previously announced the official release date for the standalone DC adventure film, set to hit theaters on June 25, 2021. Shortly after the news broke, Ben Affleck took to social media to congratulate director Matt Reeves, who will be leading the Caped Crusader into the future. It was later confirmed that the tweet was Affleck's way of bidding farewell to the character."
"When dining out, it's customary to give a tip, but a tip added to an order of milkshakes and fries at a New Jersey restaurant has left parents outraged. Melissa Desh said, ""My daughter came to tell me that every time she and her friends go to the restaurant, they're being charged a tip."" ""When I asked her why, she said, 'because they're kids,'"" Desh said. Her daughter, Isabella, and other students from Colfax Middle School often go to the Wayne Hills Diner, located across from Hamburg Turnpike."
"Dallas - Like many Americans, Martin Jacobson was thrilled by the Navy SEALs' killing of Osama bin Laden. But the Dallas resident has a deeper connection to the special forces that hunted down the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. Decades ago, he was one of them. During World War II, Jacobson was a member of an elite unit that was the precursor to the SEALs. The secretive unit is accustomed to keeping a low profile, but it's back in the headlines after the bin Laden raid. ""I'm just proud of the SEALs,"" said Jacobson, 89."
"Northern Ireland is today dubbed the race hate capital of Europe, a report on racist violence in the province concludes. Human rights campaigner Doreen Lawrence, the mother of murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence, was in Belfast for the launch of the report by the Northern Ireland Council for Ethnic Minorities (NICEM). The report highlights institutionalized racism within the justice system and questions how it can be tackled. In recent years, racist violence in Northern Ireland has been on the increase, with not just black and Asian people being targeted, but virtually anyone perceived as being different."
"About 300 villagers from Kampong Cham's Kompong Siem district yesterday submitted a petition to the Chinese embassy in Phnom Penh and then protested in front of the provincial hall, calling on Prime Minister Hun Sen to help them. The villagers told The Post that they want an end to the land disputes caused by ""land grabbing"" by the company and said they would rather die than return home without a solution. They claimed that government departments had ignored their pleas for help while the company had used the judicial system to arrest villagers who complained about the land clearance."
"The incline bench press is a strength training exercise that targets the upper chest and anterior shoulders. The exercise is performed on an incline bench, with the athlete lying on the bench and gripping dumbbells or a barbell with an overhand grip on the shoulders, then lifting the weight up over the chest by extending and flexing the elbows. Alternatively, an incline chest press machine can be used to replicate the motion, with the machine moving on a fixed plane. The incline bench press is one of several exercises that can help create a symmetrical and strong upper body."
"Klopp revealed his delight at ending Guardiola's Manchester City's 22-game unbeaten run, exclaiming ""What is that?!"" during the live broadcast, while the Liverpool manager also hit back at critics who said his defence was fragile, adding ""Blow my shoes off!"" Klopp was over the moon after Liverpool beat title favourites Manchester City 4-3. In a thrilling match at Anfield, Liverpool led 4-1 at half-time, before City scored two late goals to make for a tense finish."
"No one asked me, but... if you pay dues to a neo-Nazi organization, subscribe to racist publications, buy tickets to Holocaust denial conferences, and own Holocaust denial DVDs in your video collection, you might be a neo-Nazi. You don't become a neo-Nazi overnight. You can change your mind and your way of thinking, and come clean. If you want people to believe you're no longer a neo-Nazi, you'll have to do a lot of convincing. It takes a lot of effort to shed the brown shirt."
"Brent Moloney's first step towards making amends for his finals series drinking binge was his quiet reinstatement into the club's leadership group midway through the season. The second step was more public and more significant, as he won Melbourne's best and fairest award last night. The 27-year-old Moloney received the Keith 'Bluey' Truscott Trophy at the Crown Palladium, narrowly edging out key defender Jared Rivers and James Frawley in the voting. Moloney's two midfield teammates, Nathan Jones and Jack Trengove, finished fourth and fifth respectively."
"The Weeknd will collaborate with Daft Punk at the Grammys. Los Angeles (AP) - The Weeknd will collaborate with electronic music duo Daft Punk at the Grammys.

Maren Morris will perform with Alicia Keys. The Grammys had previously announced that Adele, John Legend, Bruno Mars, Metallica, Carrie Underwood, and Keith Urban would also perform."
"Dartmouth - On Flag Day, June 14, students from James M. Quinn Elementary School in Dartmouth gathered outside to celebrate the occasion. In itself, this was not an unusual event, but this year's ceremony held deeper meaning for them. The reason was that Ted Cote, the cousin of Dr. Carol Calafati, from New Bedford, was serving in Iraq. Earlier this year, around Veterans Day, Dr. Calafati asked her students to send cards to Sergeant Ted Cote in Iraq to boost his morale. The students responded by making cards and sending them to Iraq."
"Will UBS appoint Bob McCann or Sallie Krawcheck to a senior wealth management position? According to Investment News, citing two industry headhunters, former Merrill Lynch brokerage chief Bob McCann and former Citigroup wealth management chief Sallie Krawcheck are both potential candidates for the top wealth management position at UBS. Earlier, the Financial Times reported that UBS's new CEO Oswald Gruebel had decided not to sell the company's US wealth management business, despite rumors over the past few months that he might do so due to tax evasion charges and the subsequent scandal."
"If the outcome of the US presidential election were to be decided by social media, Barack Obama would clearly defeat Republican challenger Mitt Romney next year. The Obama campaign has already embraced social media, with the president having a large following on Facebook and Twitter, and the Democratic National Committee using a private social networking tool to communicate with some campaign staff. There is also evidence that the Obama campaign is using social media analytics tools to gauge voter sentiment and track the popularity of campaign messages. Despite contacting both campaigns to discuss their social media strategies, neither responded."
"We should stop defining what impact investing is. Now that they're gone, we can get down to business. I've been covering impact investing as a contributor for Forbes for the past four years and have written hundreds of articles on the subject. The problem is that most impact investing is only available to the wealthy. This is a guide to impact investing for everyone else, which is to say the 98% of the population that doesn't qualify to invest alongside the rich."
"The health department has issued another measles warning after a person infected with the disease used public transport and visited two universities and a supermarket.

"Today is expected to be sunny as a high-pressure system sets up over the weekend. Following a chilly start, temperatures will rise into the 40s to 50s (Fahrenheit). It is expected to be cooler tonight under mostly clear skies, with lows in the 20s to 30s (Fahrenheit) and 30s to 40s (Fahrenheit). Tomorrow, winds will come from the south, meaning we will see some milder temperatures, with highs expected to reach the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) and possibly even the 60s to 70s (Fahrenheit) in some areas. However, more clouds are expected to form as the day progresses. It appears that clouds will thin out at night, with lows in the 30s to 40s (Fahrenheit) and 40s to 50s (Fahrenheit)."
"It looks like the scene after an earthquake, with orange cardboard boxes scattered all over the floor, shoes stuffed into every gap, and people standing there in a daze of shock. But this is not a natural disaster, it's just Black Friday at a Nike factory store in Seattle. The Seattle Premium Outlets in Tulalip, Washington, shared photos and videos after the holiday, showing shoppers trampling the orange cardboard boxes that were originally used to protect Nike shoes, and wandering aimlessly around the store, picking up and discarding sports shoes in a horrifying scene."
"The 27th annual Southern Iowa Hot Air Balloon Festival is being held in Creston this weekend. Bill Fastenow, a spokesperson for the Balloon Committee, stated that wind is the key factor in determining whether hot air balloons take off and in which direction they fly. Fastenow said that a pilots' meeting will be held at 4:30 this afternoon, followed by a ""Night Glow"" event at the Creston Airport on the south side of town, which he described as a beautiful sight. Ellen Gerhart, the executive director of the Creston Chamber of Commerce, said that at least 57 hot air balloon pilots have signed up for the event this weekend.

"Stark County's unemployment rate fell to 6.8% in August, the lowest since September 2008. Stark County's unemployment rate dropped below 7% for the first time, and there are several reasons for the decline. The most likely reason is the oil and gas drilling from the Utica Shale, which has brought a plethora of businesses to the area. The first to arrive were the oil exploration companies, followed by engineering and construction companies providing various services. Manufacturing has also experienced growth due to increased demand for steel and drilling equipment from both local and national sources."
"A horror movie icon will be visiting a haunted attraction in Gaston County on Wednesday and Thursday. Actor Derek Mears, known for his roles in Friday the 13th (2009), Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, Predator, and Men in Black II, will be meeting with horror movie fans at The Haunted Mill in Belmont.

"Washington (United News Agency) - Gold prices remained stable on Thursday after the Federal Reserve released its latest economic report, which stated that businesses across the United States had become less optimistic over the past few months. Spot gold prices rose 0.2% to $1,294.11 per ounce, while US gold futures were basically flat at $1,293.75 per ounce. As the challenges facing the economy intensify, it is expected that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates stable at least until June. The dollar temporarily stopped rising after its recent gains, while the pound stabilized after British Prime Minister Theresa May won a vote of confidence in parliament and urged lawmakers to break the Brexit deal deadlock."
"President Zuma believes the Public Protector's State Capture report is a political tool used to target certain individuals. In an exclusive interview with ANN7 on Monday night, President Zuma shared his views on the State Capture report by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela. The report recommended that President Zuma appoint a judicial commission of inquiry, led by a judge chosen by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng, to investigate the allegations of State Capture. The report investigated whether President Zuma's friends, the controversial Gupta family, had undue influence over the government. President Zuma's claim that the report is a political tool has sparked widespread controversy."
"We like it because: few things are more fashionable than a good night's sleep. After all, a well-rested night can make you look radiant in the morning - and also feel refreshed. One of the most important factors affecting sleep quality is a good mattress. The new mattress comes in a variety of sizes, from single to California king size, with mattresses of all sizes made of five layers of ""high-end"" foam, including one inch of ""flo"" foam, one and a half inches of latex foam, one and a half inches of memory sponge foam, and one and a half inches of high-elastic foam, which contains supportive gel columns."
"Jenna Barker from Seton Catholic won the 1600 meters with a time of 5:13.04, setting a new regional record, and also won the 800 meters.

Other individual regional champions included Richmond's Riley Austin, who won the 200 meters and long jump; Richmond's Nakala Bennett, who won the 100 meters; Seton Catholic's Hannah Stamm, who won the 3200 meters; and Richmond's Austin, Lindsay Griffin, Peyton VanMiddlesworth, and Riley Wetzel, who won the 400-meter relay."
"When the convention's theme appears to be ""Drill, baby, drill"", an energy policy that's akin to ""Tax, baby, tax"" is fiscal policy (i.e., it isn't), it's clear that this slogan is about all the party has left. Even if you think increased offshore drilling makes sense to improve oil exploration and supply, you can't take these people seriously. Unfortunately, yes, you can. By the way, this was the moment when I completely lost interest in the convention."
"The newly appointed chairman of the National Children's Hospital board has stated that allowing the hospital's main builder to exit its role would be a ""bad commercial decision"". The new chairman, Fred Barry, who attended this morning's Oireachtas health committee meeting, also said that the project was underestimated from the start, which led to the cost increasing dramatically from an estimated €800 million in 2014 to €1.73 billion now."
"Bob Cannard was turning compost with a shovel at Green String Farm outside of Petaluma, California, the compost originally having come from food scraps in San Francisco, on Friday, March 6, 2009. As a parent and one who has worked with parents for years, I was shocked by the heart-wrenching front-page story in the El Cerrito edition about the death of an infant (""Infant Dies in Car: A Tragic Lesson for All Parents,"" June 10, 2009). The idea that parents can ""easily forget their children are left in the back seat"" is, unfortunately, true."
"Southeast Toyota Distributors, LLC (SET) is recalling certain model year 2016 Toyota Yaris, RAV4, Land Cruiser and 4Runner vehicles, and Scion FR-S, iM, and TC vehicles manufactured January 28, 2016, to March 14, 2016. The Load Carrying Capacity Modification Label may not reflect the correct added weight of the installed accessories, causing the vehicle to be overloaded, and thus not be in compliance with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard number 110, ""Tire Selection and Rims."" Consequence: An incorrect label may lead to vehicle overloading, increasing the risk of a crash."
"An attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union today asked a federal appeals court in San Francisco to block a California law that requires police to collect DNA samples from anyone accused of a felony. The law, which was part of a 2004 voter initiative, expanded DNA collection in the criminal justice system through the use of cheek swabs. Four plaintiffs are challenging a provision that took effect in 2009 requiring DNA sampling of anyone accused of a felony, regardless of whether they are charged with or convicted of a crime."
"Is that really the case? Are things really that complicated? The Green Bay News reported that the police said they would only need two to three weeks to complete the investigation into the alleged sexual assault involving Packers tight end Brandon Underwood. Underwood was accused by two Milwaukee women of sexually assaulting them after a charity event at a resort in Lake Delton, Wisconsin. The incident occurred on June 5, and a few days after the incident, police officials indicated that they suspected the incident would not lead to any charges. One big issue is that the women's stories changed, initially involving multiple Packers players, and later only involving Underwood."
"To help identify Seminole County community's perception of the Seminole County School District, a new logo will be developed using at least one of the top four winning entries from the county logo contest. School board members said they wanted a new logo because the current one - a school crossing sign - does not reflect the district's academic achievements. The contest was divided into four age groups: elementary for ages 10 and under, middle school for ages 11-14, high school for ages 15-18, and adult for ages 19 and over."
"Los Angeles (AP) - Kings forward Anze Kopitar will undergo surgery on Wednesday to repair a torn ligament suffered in a severe right ankle sprain. An MRI performed on Monday confirmed that the Kings' top scorer will require corrective surgery, which will keep him out of the lineup indefinitely.

Coach Terry Murray initially said the Slovenian All-Star had broken his ankle and would be out for at least six weeks, but the Kings ultimately determined it was only a severe high ankle sprain. Kopitar leads the Kings with 25 goals and 43 assists."
"A car crash near Waikamaramaru on State Highway 2 has left two people injured. Initial reports suggested a three-vehicle collision occurred yesterday, but police now believe two separate accidents happened at the same location, near Apata Train Station Road. A St John Ambulance spokesperson said the two injured people were taken to Tauranga Hospital, one in a serious condition and the other stable. Police initially received a report of the accident at 1:10pm. ""There were two accidents in the same area in a short space of time. It appears a van drove off the road, and then a car and a truck collided."""

"Data released by the Korean Shipbuilders' Association confirmed the expectations of many analysts: the number of active shipyards worldwide has decreased by more than 40% compared to seven years ago. The study defines an active shipyard as one that has at least one ship on order. According to the association's data, the number of active shipyards in China decreased from 380 to 140, and the number of shipyards in Japan decreased from 70 to 60 during the same period. What's worse, the world's largest shipyards - Daewoo Shipbuilding, Hyundai Heavy Industries, and Samsung Heavy Industries - may have idle space and unused capacity at some point next year."
"""Interaction of Color"", a groundbreaking book published by Josef Albers in 1963, Albers, a German-born artist and educator who taught at the Bauhaus, Black Mountain College, and Yale University, is not just for aspiring artists.

"Defending champion Victoria Azarenka narrowly defeated injured American Jamie Hampton 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 on Saturday to advance to the fourth round of the Australian Open. Hampton, who required a medical timeout due to lower back problems, often grimaced in pain after saving her serve in the second set and throughout the third, on the verge of tears, but still managed to hit 41 winners, putting pressure on top-ranked Azarenka. Azarenka, who at times looked frustrated, overcame early errors and saved three break points in the decisive seventh game of the match, eventually winning in 2 hours and 9 minutes."
"Suzuki Motor Corporation found that 6,401 vehicles out of 12,819 had undergone improper testing since 2012. In a major blow to Japanese automakers, Suzuki Motor Corporation announced that the company had been using improper fuel economy and emissions testing in Japan. According to the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism, Suzuki, along with Mazda and Toyota, admitted to cheating in emissions tests and submitting selectively manufactured vehicles in the quality assurance process.

"Brands should resist the temptation to tackle sensitive topics in the Super Bowl in order to draw attention, said Aimee Drolet, a marketing and behavioral decision-making professor at UCLA's Anderson School of Management in Los Angeles, California: ""Generally, it's not the best place to do these things because the audience is so broad, and you're always going to offend half the people,"" she said. In other news, University of California officials announced that the system's 10 campuses set a new fundraising record in 2017-18, raising more than $2.7 billion."
"Margaret O'Brien, 69, moved to Wolverhampton from Canada in 1971, got married, had three children, and worked for the local council for over 25 years, doing various jobs such as a waitress, a restaurant waitress, a traffic warden, and a cleaner.

"Searching for ""toxic yeast"" yields hundreds of frightening warnings and ""studies"", but few are scientifically based - and many are motivated by financial gain. Recently, one of my patients was hospitalized for alcoholic liver failure. He had a long history of liver disease, but insisted that no one had ever told him to avoid alcohol. Initially, he admitted to only having ""a few drinks"", but as other medical personnel questioned him further, his story changed to more. Despite his liver being in severe shock, he remained stable, and fortunately, most of his liver function was still intact."

An Estonian immigrant and his accomplice had initially planned to commit suicide due to hunger and bankruptcy because they felt abandoned by the Estonian community, but they decided to kill a woman living in North Hollywood first, because they believed she was the root of their problems, so she couldn't mock their death.

"Two groups concerned about mental health care want to know which Vermont doctors received thousands of dollars in gifts from pharmaceutical companies last year. Due to a law protecting trade secrets, pharmaceutical companies can keep some names confidential. The two groups believe this loophole should be closed. Last year, Vermont doctors and other healthcare providers received approximately $3.1 million in gifts from pharmaceutical companies. Vermont is one of the few states that require pharmaceutical companies to disclose such marketing expenses. These payments include consulting fees, travel expenses, gifts, and speaking fees. The two groups believe that pharmaceutical companies bribing doctors may influence their prescribing behavior, thereby affecting patients' health. Therefore, they are calling for the closure of this loophole to make the names of all doctors who receive gifts from pharmaceutical companies publicly transparent. The two groups hope to protect patients' right to health through this approach, while also increasing the transparency and fairness of the healthcare system."

It's strange that my eyes were filled with tears before I even knew what had happened and why. It's interesting that your intuition controls your thoughts before your brain reacts."

"Delray Beach - Delray Beach's overdose cases are decreasing, continuing last year's trend. The latest data collected by the Delray Beach Police Department shows that the city had fewer overdose cases in March than it did last year and in 2016, when the number of overdose cases reported reached a record high. As the entire nation struggles to cope with the widespread opioid epidemic, Delray Beach, often referred to as the ""recovery capital,"" has seen a decline in both the number of recovery centers and overdose cases. In March, there were 21 overdose cases, roughly one-third of the 59 overdose cases reported in March 2017."

"Among all German surface warships, the British feared Bismarck the most. She posed a clear threat to Allied shipping in the Atlantic and had to be sunk. In July 2001, the wreck of Hood was discovered at a depth of 9,334 feet below the surface of the Denmark Strait. It had broken into three sections, with the bow upright, the middle portion inverted, and the stern deeply buried in the seabed. In 2013, the wreck was further explored by a remotely operated vehicle."
"The input text appears to contain a mixture of Chinese characters, English words, and punctuation marks, but due to the chaotic nature of the text, its overall meaning is unclear.

If we attempt to extract and translate the recognizable Chinese parts, we may find the following:

- "","" translates to ""and""
- "","" in this case translates to ""and"" or ""comma"", but its usage is ambiguous without a clear sentence
- ""!"" translates to an exclamation mark

Given that the input text lacks coherent sentences or phrases, it is impossible to provide a meaningful translation that conveys specific information or ideas. The text seems to be a mixture of characters and symbols without a clear structure or context, and therefore, a clear translation cannot be provided."
"Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze is the Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister for European Integration. Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze, the Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister for European Integration, described the importance of the country's association agreement with the EU in an interview with a Spanish EU activist. The Ukraine-EU association agreement came into effect on September 1, an important step in bilateral relations. For the past three months, Ukrainians have been able to travel to the EU without a visa. Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze explained the significance of the agreement for her country, the work her government has done so far, and what Ukraine can offer to the EU."
"Washington - RFK Stadium, once and future home of the capital's Major League Baseball team, is not now an ideal place to play. It is configured for soccer, not baseball. The field needs to be changed, the seats, locker rooms and press box upgraded. Last week, on a rainy day, a quarter of the field was mud and tire tracks. It looked like a place where Vince Lombardi should have been coaching football - and he was, for the Washington Redskins, in 1969. But that was 1969."
"The millennial generation is not a homogeneous group, so a unified marketing strategy does not work. Millennials want healthy food and are willing to pay more for it. No, wait - millennials are saddled with debt, but still want affordable healthy food. They are also very conscious of privilege. But they are creative and tech-savvy, which is a good thing. And no matter what you do, do not try to reach them through traditional advertising, but rather through social media. All of this sounds familiar because it is just a small part of the many contradictory reports about millennials."
"A series of powerful shorts where children explain in their own words how to live with various illnesses and allergies. The shorts are relevant to the PSHE and Modern Studies curriculum for KS2, KS3 and KS4 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and 2nd, 3rd and 4th levels in Scotland.

Tonight, four Owls scored in double figures, including Stapleton, who scored 19 points and grabbed 9 rebounds. Big man Karlis Silins scored 14 points and grabbed 10 rebounds, completing a double-double in the game."
"The events that took place in the UK this week have undoubtedly shocked audiences around the world. Lootings and arson have exposed the inner city landscapes of London, Birmingham, and Manchester, which is an image of England that is usually presented to the outside world through historical dramas, Hugh Grant movies, or stories about Prince William and Kate Middleton. If this exposure has left outsiders feeling confused, it is equally perplexing for the British. The current atmosphere in the UK is a mix of anger, fear, and confusion. It's not that we're unaccustomed to riots; we are. England experienced riots in 1981, the year of the royal wedding."

"Recent studies have shown that after inducing Alzheimer's-like symptoms in mice, their cognitive function improved after receiving synthetic estrogen-like hormones. Dr. Christian Pike, associate professor of gerontology at the University of Southern California and leader of the research team, said: ""This synthetic hormone improves behavior in a way that is similar to estrogen."" However, while estrogen can cause the uterus to grow and is a known risk factor for uterine and breast cancer, PPT did not noticeably alter the reproductive tract of the animals. ""This could be a promising strategy to maximize the benefits of hormone therapy while minimizing its risks,"" Pike said."

"Abandoning the usual large-scale, over-budget outdoor concerts to promote their latest album, rock band Oasis has started hiring street performers to do their promotional work for them. Last Friday, a group of street performers gathered to play the band's new songs at various locations in Manhattan. The motley crew included a violinist, guitarists, and of course, a few living statues covered in gold paint. They played in all five boroughs, from subway platforms to park plazas, and even in the pouring rain. Tos and Dominic Del Principe were among those who got soaked."
"In her weekly therapy sessions, Julie revealed her most uncomfortable secrets: depression, debt, and childhood molestation. Her Massachusetts General Hospital psychiatrist would then enter a summary into Julie's computerized medical records. As a result, more than 200 pages of sensitive notes could be viewed by any doctor who had ever treated her on the shared medical network. Julie didn't find out about this until later, when a doctor referenced the notes. Julie, a 43-year-old lawyer, initially felt uncomfortable and later became angry. ""These details are nobody's business,"" she said. But Shared Medical disagreed. Julie's psychiatrist would enter these secrets into her computerized medical records, making them available to any doctor who had ever treated her on the shared medical network."
"What is truly needed to get the private sector involved in healthcare is a significant increase in public sector investment to cover more people. The country got a new healthcare policy after 14 years. Such a long gap itself indicates the priority, or the lack of it, to a sector that requires urgent attention and is closely linked to the vision of rapid development and emerging as a strong nation in the global order. The new policy proposed seven key transformations in healthcare organizations, including a shift from selective to comprehensive primary healthcare, which is popular and closely linked to referral hospitals. Additionally, the new policy also emphasizes the importance of preventive care, public health, and healthcare services, as well as the role of medical information technology and electronic health records in improving healthcare services."
"The CEO of Vodafone Hutchison Australia, Iñaki Berroeta, is attempting to temper expectations around Australia's upcoming 5G network, stating that while the company is progressing with its 5G deployment, he does not expect consumer devices to be available until the end of 2019. Berroeta declined to discuss VHA's spectrum ambitions in the Australian 5G space, instead emphasizing the need to establish a new ""ecosystem"" for mobile technology before operators begin promoting products. He predicted that when 5G networks are launched, ""most markets"" will see devices become available within one to two months."
"A church in Schuylkill County is set to commemorate the late Father Walter Ciszek, S.J. this weekend. He is a priest from Shenandoah who is currently being considered for sainthood. The Walter Ciszek Prayer League Center, located in Shenandoah, will be bustling with activity this weekend.

He died in 1984 at the age of 80. ""We think Father Ciszek was a very special person who dedicated his life to God and the Church. His experience in the Soviet Union was extremely difficult, but he never gave up his faith. He is a true hero and a model worth learning from."" The museum has collected many artifacts from Ciszek's life, including his clothes, books, and photos. These items allow people to better understand Ciszek's life and faith. The staff at the museum hope that through these exhibits, more people will learn about Father Ciszek's story and draw inspiration from his life."
"I was just reminded of why I abandoned my career in financial news 11 years ago, including my stint as a reporter on Wall Street. While the financial world has its fascinating aspects, I grew disillusioned with the dominant narrative that it's solely about the money, rather than other considerations such as values and social impact, which seemed to never enter the picture. Given the testosterone-filled trading floors and city executives who live almost exclusively disconnected from ordinary people, it's not entirely surprising."
"A report to be released on Tuesday will detail how an unknown cyber hacker breached computers in South Carolina and stole tax returns of millions of residents over several years. The report was covered by NBC's Michael Isikoff. Columbia, South Carolina - In August last year, staff at the South Carolina Department of Revenue received a malicious email that allowed an international hacker to breach the state's computers and gain access to 3.8 million tax returns, including social security numbers and bank account information. Experts describe it as the largest cyber attack against a state government in history, according to details from the report to be released on Tuesday. The attack was carried out through a phishing email, which gave the hacker permission to enter the state's computer system and steal large amounts of sensitive information. According to the report, the hacker stole tax returns of millions of residents over several years, including social security numbers and bank account information."
"Syria: Why is Assad's power expanding? In the presidential election held in early June, Assad was declared the winner with 88.7% of the vote. Given the nature of this regime, this is not unexpected. However, despite the fact that these elections were not ""free"" in any sense of the word, and many people were unable to vote because they are refugees living abroad, the result suggests that a large portion of the Syrian people still support Assad. Why is this? Stop the criminal attacks on Gaza! Yesterday, the Israeli military launched a ground attack on Gaza."
"Butler made headlines last week after posting a letter signed by Barack Obama on her website, describing her as ""intelligent, wise and determined"". She later admitted that the words were penned by her staff and Obama had simply signed it. Before entering the Commons, Butler was an official for the GMB union. In 2005, she replaced Paul Boateng to become the MP for Brent South, and became the third black woman to be an MP. In September 2008, she was promoted to her current role. Butler is the daughter of Jamaican immigrants who grew up in London, where her parents owned a small West Indian and European bakery."

"BlackBerry Ltd. has decided not to renew a licensing agreement that allowed T-Mobile US Inc. to sell its products. A promotional mishap last month strained the relationship between BlackBerry and T-Mobile, which had previously worked together for many years. On Wednesday, BlackBerry announced that it would not renew the licensing agreement, which is set to expire on April 25. In February, T-Mobile offended the Canadian smartphone manufacturer by sending a message to its BlackBerry users, offering an iPhone 5s with no upfront cost. The Seattle-based carrier later attempted to mend its relationship with BlackBerry through a second promotion, offering a $200 credit to BlackBerry users when they traded in their old devices for any new T-Mobile phone. BlackBerry stated that this decision would not affect its partnerships with other carriers."
"On November 17, 2015, at 12:55 in the morning, Michael Hoppen had to change the habits he had formed in Manhattan. We realized that in Manhattan, the cost was too high for us. We looked everywhere and finally came to this area, and we found the houses to be stunning, feeling great. The homeowner who sold us the house, Rodney and Desmond, live next door. They received several offers, and I think they might have wanted us to be their neighbors - a couple expecting a child, wanting to buy their first home. I believe this might have been more attractive than paying an extra 0.1% down payment."

Shortly after the acquisition, he founded Transmit Security. Interestingly, Boodae did not seek venture capital, stating that putting his own money and that of his co-founder Rakesh Loonkar into the startup made him feel like he was starting his first company all over again, but this time without having to report to anyone else."

Note: This solution does not remove any ranch water dams, as they provide us with valuable services, but rather modifies them. The pipes can be set at a height that allows water to be retained for livestock, wildlife, and other species."

"Washington — South Florida has long been home to some of the nation's most intense political battlegrounds, with opponents employing tactics such as creating phantom candidates to siphon off votes from their rivals, or hiring so-called boleteras, or ballot brokers, to improperly fill out large numbers of absentee ballots for elderly or disabled voters. But the 2016 election cycle was unprecedented, with several Democratic congressional candidates becoming targets of Russian influence operations, and thousands of pages of documents from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's Washington office being hacked and leaked to reporters and bloggers in Florida."

"I want to follow up on a viewer's question because we just started a lively discussion about how to save big bucks. Recently, on GMA Weekend and ABC News Now, I reported on how hiring a medical bill advocate can help you find and fix hospital bill errors, saving you thousands of dollars. According to the Medical Billing Advocates of America, 80% of hospital bills contain errors. One of the biggest misconceptions about medical billing errors is that most insurance companies pay a fixed fee for hospital stays or surgeries."

Apart from their close relationship with William, the two men had one thing in common: they both wanted to clear his name."
"Where America goes, Britain often follows, and this is particularly true of the negative aspects. If America experiences extreme weather, we usually follow suit a few days later. If America's violent crime rate rises, so does ours. And then, there's the shopping frenzy. Britain is adopting traditional American events such as post-Christmas sales, bankrupting customers and once again owning things they don't want. Black Friday has just passed, today is Cyber Monday, and each shopping day becomes part of the retail calendar on both sides of the Atlantic."
"It's been over a decade since Eminem played his sole leading role in the movie 8 Mile, and you could reasonably assume that his acting career started and ended there. However, the former Marshall Mathers has for years been a strong contender to star in Anthony Fuqua's boxing drama Southpaw, a project that like many others has been stuck in development limbo. Now that the project has been picked up by The Weinstein Company, although Eminem is not technically out of the running, he may be about to be replaced by some of the biggest stars."

"On the East Coast, voters bravely faced the cold, waiting in the pre-dawn darkness to cast their ballots, marking the end of one of the most grueling and expensive campaigns in U.S. history. They were faced with two distinctly different visions for getting America's economy back on its feet. At the Falls Church Community Center, over 100 people had already been waiting for more than half an hour by 6:00 a.m. local time, with the polling station set up in the basement gym. ""The polls are now open, go vote!"" they were told. They had to choose between two men with distinctly different ideas about economic recovery."
"As a veteran of the climate change activism movement, I've grown accustomed to disappointment. So, when I was summoned to the office of the Senior Associate to the President of Stanford as the coordinator of Stanford's ""Fossil Free Stanford"" group, I attended the meeting with some trepidation. My concerns were well-founded. Earlier that morning, Harvard had arrested a student for demanding a public discussion on fossil fuel divestment. The previous fall, Brown had flatly rejected student demands to divest from the thirteen dirtiest coal companies. Efforts to implement climate policies at the national and international levels hadn't fared much better."

"Don Draper: Who's crying now? Last month, when Jon Hamm hosted Saturday Night Live, his monologue told the story of his supposed pre-Mad Men career, showcasing clips of him in various roles - all of which looked and sounded like a typical, über-confident 1960s ad man Don Draper - including a QVC host and a Def Comedy Jam comedian.

"The airline operates 744 mainline aircraft, ranging in size from 50 to 366 seats. For a typical 737 aircraft that carries 179 passengers, this weight-saving measure means a reduction of about 11 pounds per flight. According to reports, stopping the sale of duty-free items, such as ""perfume, chocolates and liquor"", on planes would save 1.4 million gallons of fuel and $2.3 million annually for United Airlines. This implies that United Airlines earns less than $2.3 million in revenue from selling these items on planes, or that allowing passengers to buy these items on the ground would not have a significant impact on its revenue."

"The controversy between US intelligence agencies and their elected President Donald Trump is not only bewildering but also a special case for assessing the principles that should govern the relationship between national intelligence and political administration under a democratic system. In theory, an intelligence-based national security system is responsible for detecting and tracking any national security threats, whether external or internal, and dedicating itself to eliminating them. However, it operates under the authorization of an elected political administration, which is the highest sovereign authority. Under a democratic system, the political administration is the ultimate embodiment and representative of national sovereignty. Therefore, the relationship between the national security system and the political administration is complex and subtle, requiring a balance to be struck to ensure that the national security system can effectively fulfill its duties while also being subject to the supervision and restraint of the political administration. This balance is crucial for ensuring the effectiveness of the national security system and the healthy operation of the democratic system. The controversy between US intelligence agencies and President Trump highlights the importance of this balance and the complexity of the relationship between the national security system and the political administration under a democratic system."

KUNC-FM reported Tuesday that Senate Secretary Effie Ameen sent two emails reminding staff that giving interviews to reporters would be a violation of legislative policy. Ameen sent the emails in February and March, when Senate Republican leaders insisted that complaints of sexual misconduct and workplace harassment against lawmakers should be kept confidential under the legislature's workplace harassment policy, or handled by prosecutors."
"It was a Saturday morning in August, I remember it very clearly. At the time, I was online, sitting on my bed, browsing aimlessly. An article caught my attention: it was about the refugee crisis. Men, women, and children were risking their lives to get to Western Europe, and many were losing their lives along the way. It was a story of resilience and traumatic horror. I had expected to see sympathy and compassion, but as I read the comments, my heart sank. They were filled with cruelty."
"Central American referee Carlos Batres put on the worst acting performance in the World Cup, which is saying something for an Italian, as he is the second best actor next to Federico Fellini, thus depriving the New Zealand All Whites of a historic win over the current football world champions. This brings back memories of the 2006 World Cup match between Australia and Italy, where Italy won with a man disadvantage in injury time, thanks to Fabio Grosso diving under Lucas Neill's defense. In simple terms, four-time World Cup winners Italy cheated their way back into the game."

"He wore jeans, was slender, and exuded that kind of aura. Many fans think this nickname is an unfortunate byproduct of his success at the time. On Tuesday, November 14, the real Rambo went backstage to visit Springsteen after ""Springsteen on Broadway"".

"Over the past five years, the Internet has undergone changes beyond people's expectations. It is no longer just a browsing medium: it is filled with Web 2.0 applications, real-time communication challenges, and various threats that are designed to exploit this new usage. As a result, network security has undergone incredible changes - simply blocking, stopping, or suppressing IP sessions is no longer enough. Network filtering is unable to meet the security challenges. This webinar will explain the changes in the way the Internet is used, and how your understanding of IT may not be in line with the actual behavior of users, resulting in your security controls being bypassed."
"The fourth episode of ""The Newsroom"" titled ""I'll Try to Change Your Mind"" can also be seen as the title of the entire series. Similar to Sorkin's ""The West Wing"", the show attempts to change America through the story of Will McAvoy, a successful, cynical, and apathetic cable news anchor who decides that he, the news industry, and the democratic system can all do better. What does this mean? Will's producer and ex-girlfriend Mackenzie McHale explains: ""Take back the fourth estate"". This phrase refers to the news media as the fourth pillar that oversees the government and provides the public with accurate information, and Mackenzie hopes that Will can reclaim this function of the news media by reporting real news and thought-provoking commentary to change America."

"My daughter, who is a resident advisor at her university, recently mentioned that she may be hosting more foreign exchange students in the fall and seemed somewhat complaining about it. When I asked her why this was a bad thing, she said that foreign exchange students often think Americans are stupid unless they prove otherwise. They think Americans don't travel as widely as they do, aren't as fluent in foreign languages as they are, and aren't as knowledgeable about world cultures as they are. I said what any good American would say: why don't they just stay home? Oh, she replied, it's not that they think our universities are stupid."

Arizona has approved all necessary health professional licenses to provide patients with a comprehensive approach to addressing chronic pain issues.

"The Abortion Supervisory Committee of New Zealand is appealing a High Court judge's ruling that there are reasonable grounds to believe that many abortions in the country are unlawful. According to the law, a registered practitioner can legally perform an abortion in New Zealand only after obtaining a certificate from two certifying consultants appointed by the Abortion Supervisory Committee. The appeal also argues that the court made an error of law in thinking that the committee can form its own opinion on the lawfulness of certifying consultants approving or declining abortions."

"Ricky Kalgaard: You should focus on four areas. One is financial regulation, which still makes it difficult for small businesses to get loans. You mentioned healthcare regulation, Obamacare has increased the cost burden in many ways. Then there's environmental regulation, which is a broad field that is strangling small businesses, especially in California where I live. Farmers in California are being squeezed, supposedly to protect certain insects. And then you have labor regulation. Last year, we saw the National Labor Relations Board take action against Boeing."
"To create a ""diversionary event"", foreign forces attacked key power plants in Venezuela, which ""have Canadian-made equipment"", Maria Zakharova explained, and the perpetrators were well aware of all the algorithms and vulnerabilities of the Venezuelan power grid.

"Can we price our faith? This is a question raised by believers as the tradition of tithing - donating 10% of one's income to the church - faces increasing challenges. Opponents of tithing believe it is a misinterpretation of the Bible, a human creation rather than God's will. They think there should be freedom to choose the amount to donate, and are therefore arguing with pastors, writing letters, and even protesting by leaving the church. In response, some pastors are changing their teachings and abandoning a fundraising method that has been one of the most popular for decades."

State police inspector Marcelo Arigony, who is leading the investigation into the deadly fire that occurred over the weekend, told reporters at a press conference on Tuesday that the band members knowingly purchased pyrotechnics that were only suitable for outdoor use because they cost $1.25 each, while indoor pyrotechnics cost $35.

"Several bills in the New Jersey legislature have caught the attention of the state's truck drivers and other road users. Repeat offenders of drunk driving may soon face harsher penalties. Currently, New Jersey law only classifies punishment for affected offenders as traffic offenses, with bail typically set at $2,500. Classifying it as a traffic offense allows drivers charged with drunk driving to continue driving while waiting for their court date. A pending state legislative bill aims to put an end to this practice. Instead, A3057 would increase penalties for individuals convicted of drunk driving two or more times within 60 days, designating it as a fourth-degree crime."

"A troublemaking Dutch journalist was paid by former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin's political action committee, an investigation by Mother Jones has found. Over the past few months, Palin's PAC, SarahPAC, has paid out thousands of dollars to a mysterious company that has gone to great lengths to conceal its ownership.

The Meyers were welcomed by the Carillon Beach community and opened their café on March 21, and will be organizing the Carillon Beach Farmers Market this summer."
"The Bible teaches us to ""resist the devil and he will flee from you"" (James 4:7), and also tells us to stay away from those who are controlled by all kinds of evil desires (see 1 Timothy 3:5-6). In God's eyes, many great leaders have fallen into the temptations of the flesh, possibly ruining their lives and ministries. Someone said, ""It takes a lifetime to build integrity, but only a minute to lose it."" This is a true statement! I believe one of the main reasons leaders fall is that most leaders have never consciously built a firewall in their minds and emotions."

"The band Led Zeppelin plagiarized from the 1960s band Spirit? The Voice plagiarized from American Idol? In a recent lawsuit, the heirs of the composer of the song ""Taurus"" claimed that ""Stairway To Heaven"" infringed on copyright law. Creators have been borrowing from each other for centuries. But what is the real harm - is it financial, artistic, or something else? How much of the original work is transplanted into the new work? It's always a gray area. Music copyright lawsuits have been going on for over a century."
"A detailed upgrade process, I hope it will be helpful to you if you don't have such experience before. Let me be responsible for removing the screws at the back, being careful with the keyboard sliding connection to the blue connector, and gently pulling it out. Remove the back again, start removing the screws, and take out the bracket. Now start replacing the solid-state drive. Great, the solid-state drive perfectly matches the slot. Tighten the screws to secure the solid-state drive. Evaluate the performance of the solid-state drive, it surprises me again, getting a score of 7.8. As far as I know, the highest score is 7.9."

She previously served as editor-in-chief of Columbia Journal, and as blog editor for Asymptote and Words Without Borders.

The Pride Park boss is also believed to be keen on Scunthorpe's highly-rated Gary Hooper, Sheffield United's Billy Sharp and Everton's James Vaughan, who he took on loan last season."
"The rally video shot by Ken Block is extremely stunning. However, the New South Wales police did not want Ken Block to shoot this particular rally video in Sydney - the video you see above. The Hoonigan team turned to New York instead, leaving Australia behind. Here is the video they shot - a video that could have been shot with the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Opera House, and our most iconic landmarks as the backdrop. Ken Block's Gymkhana Nine was shot in conjunction with the release of the video game Forza Horizon 3, which is set in Australia - so it made sense to shoot Gymkhana Nine in Australia."

"The photographs of Yemen we published are perhaps the most disturbing we have ever published. Here is why we decided to publish them. In our recent coverage of Yemen, a 7-year-old Yemeni girl, Amal Hussein, appeared before us, her gaze striking, from a country on the brink of war and famine. Amal's body was skeletal, her head tilted to one side, as if she could not bear to face the person looking at her straight on. Some readers may have had the same impulse, to look away."

Mnuchin attempted to alleviate growing uncertainty on Capitol Hill as President Trump escalated his trade war with China."
"January 29, 2015: Follow the money. One reason the new peace talks are making progress is that the factions that control most of the population are willing to make concessions in order to help halt the rapid decline in the standard of living nationwide. If the decline can be halted the factions are willing to make concessions. The fighting between factions, especially between the two governments that claim to rule the whole country, has led to a withering of economic activity and an increase in shortages. Then there is the violence from Islamic terrorism. While most Libyans are grateful for the help Islamic terrorists provided in 2011 to overthrow Kaddafi, since then these groups have become a greater plague than Kaddafi's secret police."
"The fundamental difference between humans and machines lies in two key aspects: creativity and empathy. Regardless of how advanced artificial intelligence becomes, these two aspects are the reasons why agency services will continue to exist and why marketers will remain busy in the next few years. The purpose of AI is to be a complement to your work, enhancing your abilities. AI can bring a layer of efficiency to companies that they previously lacked, and give them more time to complete those incremental tasks. Agency companies were successful in the past because they were creative."

"Narendra Modi's electoral challenge: creating jobs, lots of jobs.

"Brazil is currently implementing the ""Brazil Without Poverty"" plan, a continuation of the successful ""Zero Hunger"" plan, according to Marques Portela. In 2003, former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva launched the ""Zero Hunger"" plan, which is believed to have lifted 30 to 40 million Brazilians out of poverty. One of the core actions of the plan was to provide free school meals to poor children, which were purchased by the government from family farms. This practice not only supported local small farmers but also provided high-quality nutrition to children from low-income families. The plan also provided cash transfers and vocational training to poor families, further improving their living standards. Through these measures, the ""Zero Hunger"" plan achieved significant results in reducing poverty in Brazil."

"The head of the United Nations fact-finding mission on the Gaza conflict, Judge Richard Goldstone, urged the international community to take action to end the impunity of Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory for violations of international law as he presented the team's report to the Human Rights Council.

"The North Korean Minister of Lightweight Affairs had the principal task of countering every statement ever made by any French intellectual. One year, he particularly targeted Jean-Paul Sartre, first countering Sartre's assertion that ""three o'clock is always too early or too late for anything you want to do"". Since it was a languid Friday afternoon, the Minister of Lightweight Affairs simply made a quick phone call and named his local football team 4:25 Sports Club. This made Sartre look absurd, as all of the team's matches started at 4:25 in the afternoon. In fact, every time they played, their fans would chant ""Sartre, are you watching?"""
