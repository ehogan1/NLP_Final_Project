Nick is in a relatively new romance with Reagan, and Winston is actually dating Eli. So, what can we expect? Here are six things that excite us the most this season. 1. We'll see more of Reagan. If you enjoyed Megan Fox's appearance in the previous season of ""New Girl"", then you must be pleased that she's back."

"Within the framework of the LifeMedGreenRoof project, the Directorate for Standards within the Malta Competition and Consumer Affairs Authority (MCCAA) held a second stakeholder meeting to launch public consultations on a national standard for green roofs. In line with the EU's 2020 strategy, which aims to reduce energy consumption by at least 20 percent by 2020, the European Commission's 2011 Energy Efficiency Plan identified buildings as having the greatest potential for energy savings. The plan focuses on mechanisms to reduce energy consumption in existing buildings - particularly in public buildings - and on the role of projects in promoting energy efficiency measures."
"Voter fraud has been confirmed in several states, including Mississippi. Louisiana's top election official is warning residents about potential scams aimed at getting their personal information after similar issues arose in several other states. The scam involves a call from a person claiming to work for a voter registration organization. The callers offer to register residents over the phone, and in some cases, send the voter a mail-in ballot, said Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin. According to state law, residents cannot register to vote or request a mail-in ballot over the phone."
"For small businesses that sell on credit, accounts receivable can make up a significant portion of the balance sheet. During an annual audit, auditors will verify that you can substantiate your claims about accounts receivable. These claims are known as assertions. The most common audit procedure related to accounts receivable is confirmation, where the auditor will ask your customers to confirm their account. Knowing which assertions can be proven through confirmation will help you understand why your auditor requires multiple audit procedures for the same account. Accounts receivable confirmations are primarily used to prove the existence assertion."
"Rejoice that you're not Jim Furyk today. 1. The American team came out on Sunday with a huge four-point advantage in the Ryder Cup, and local fans were expecting another dominant day. 2. Luke Donald won the first match of the day against Bubba Watson, making the score 10-7. Nevertheless, the US has a big advantage. However. 3. Europe's Paul Lowry completely outplayed Brandt Snedeker, earning another point for Europe. 4. At least Keegan Bradley, the best player on the American team all weekend, was showing good fight against Rory McIlroy."
"It happens: you hit the snooze button once, twice, and then three times, so that by the time you finally get out of the shower, get dressed, and are ready to tackle the day, you're already running behind schedule. Often, this causes you to skip breakfast altogether. It turns out that your breakfast habit is one of the time-saving steps that shouldn't be skipped. Firstly, consuming a nutritious, high-protein, and balanced breakfast every morning is a proven way to kick-start your brain, improve concentration, and productivity. Additionally, breakfast is associated with better weight control, as it provides your body with energy and can reduce hunger later in the day."
"Dublin: Lawmakers voted overwhelmingly on Friday to support Ireland's first abortion bill, legalizing the practice in exceptional cases where doctors deem a woman's life to be at risk due to her pregnancy, thus taking the first legislative step away from a total ban in the predominantly Catholic country. Weary lawmakers applauded the Friday vote of 127-31, while outside the parliament gates, abortion rights activists cheered, watching the result on their smartphones. This was the culmination of grueling debates that pitted lawmakers from Wednesday morning until 5 am Thursday and, after a sleep break, until midnight Friday."
"The best Halloween costumes are inspired by the most memorable moments of the year, and 2016 was no exception. We had the Summer Olympics and the US presidential election, which every four years dominate the front pages of newspapers (and Facebook feeds!). Add to that Beyoncé's visually stunning album, the hype around Pokémon Go, and the colorful, quotable chaos of the movie ""Suicide Squad"", and 2016 was practically begging for a Halloween costume boom. We've become experts in all things Halloween - producing content that's been viewed over a billion times. That's where we come in."

"VOLGOGRAD/GELENDZHIK, Russia (Reuters) - Iceland will try not to melt in the Volgograd heat when they play Nigeria in their second World Cup match on Friday after impressively holding two-time champions Argentina to a draw over the weekend. World Cup debutants Iceland are dreaming of the knockout stage and writing a new chapter in one of the most remarkable stories in international football in recent years. Standing in their way is not only Nigeria, who desperately need a win after losing their opening match to Croatia 2-0, but also the challenge of the heat in the southern Russian city."
"Two thieves from Metro Vancouver have been arrested and charged after allegedly committing a long series of mail thefts and identity-related crimes. Following an investigation into mail theft by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police from Coquitlam and Canada Post inspectors, investigators identified a key suspect, made arrests, and used search warrants to seize a large quantity of evidence, according to an November 11 press release from the Coquitlam Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Hai Ne Hat, a 49-year-old Surrey resident well-known to police, faces six charges, including mail theft, unauthorized use of a postal key, as well as possession of stolen mail and a stolen credit card."
"First, we looked at which major brands are the most expensive to maintain over the first 10 years of a vehicle's life. We grouped all models by brand to calculate the average cost per brand. To estimate annual maintenance costs, we determined the amount spent on every other oil change (since oil changes are typically done every six months). German imports, perhaps not surprisingly, top the list by a wide margin. Toyota and its two brands, Lexus and Scion, are among the cheapest, saving owners at least $10,000 over ten years compared to BMW."
"AURORA, Illinois - A suburban teenager died after a tragic accident in a school parking lot.

"Veteran congressman Jim Leach (R-Iowa) was defeated in 2006 in a brutal showdown. I am not a defender of ""moderate Republicans,"" but it's worth saying that Leach, in my opinion, was, without a doubt, the best Republican in the House. Nonetheless, one can only rejoice at his defeat. The fact that it happened only shows how fundamentally rotten the entire Republican party machine is. Leach was, in many ways, a man with genuinely decent instincts and some fundamentally correct ideas about how the US should behave in the world. Nonetheless, in practice, he was useless."
"Donald Trump's tweets have long raised questions about whether they violate Twitter's rules against abusive behavior on the service. On Monday, after a Trump tweet threatened that North Korea ""won't be around much longer"", Twitter was forced to explain why the president wasn't blocked from the service. In a six-tweet statement from Twitter's public policy account, the company said that Twitter takes into account ""newsworthiness"" and ""public interest"" when determining whether a user has violated its rules. These factors have long been used internally by the company when deciding the fate of a problematic user, Twitter said."
"No one can predict with certainty when the stock markets will end their record bull run. But the best way for investors to cope with the impending downturn is to stay calm and stick to a well-thought-out plan. The Star asked Ellie Fstein Gerstl, author of ""30-day financial detox: take control of your money, manage your expenses and eliminate financial stress forever"", why people find it so hard to manage their own finances - and how they can do it better. There are also other common expenses that people often overlook or accidentally misrepresent."
"After the first two months of the year went largely according to plan, Summit County real estate sales took a hit in March, leading to a notable downturn in first-quarter numbers, according to data from Slifer Smith & Frampton.

"South Bend (Indiana) -- On Thursday morning, the Irish took to the field for their final practice before the Blue-Gold game on Saturday. One of the biggest questions the team has faced entering spring ball remains unanswered: who will replace the linebacker? Defensive coordinator Clark Lea said that fifth-year linebacker Asmar Bilal is currently closest to being ""the guy"" in the unit, but seems to agree with the uncertainty. He believes the position has made big strides over the past month and a half, but is in no rush to have everything in place, as the first week of the season is still months away."
"This month, Drake wrapped up his residency at the O2 Arena in London. But he wasn't ready to fly back across the ocean and head home just yet. Instead, over the weekend, he joined Tiffany Calver, host of a rap show on BBC 1Xtra, and became her co-host for the day. While he was there, he talked about a lot of things. He reminisced about the early days of his career and even commented on rumors that he's a culture vulture, as he appropriates British and Caribbean cultures. But the most interesting thing, well, at least for us Africans, was his admiration for Niniola."

"It's hard to overstate the success and growing power of Amazon. Their market capitalization is hovering just below $1 trillion. Their growth rates have been staggering. By most estimates, Amazon now accounts for nearly 50% of all online sales in the US, around 5% of all retail sales, and significantly more than their next 10 competitors combined. One study shows that around 55% of all online product searches start on Amazon. This week's report that Amazon is considering opening up to 3,000 of its cashierless Amazon Go stores by 2021 has garnered a lot of attention, despite them having just opened their fourth location just a few days ago."
"NEW YORK — An attorney who had a meltdown towards employees of a Spanish-speaking restaurant in New York apologized on Tuesday. ""To those people I offended, I apologize. Seeing myself online, I opened my eyes - the way I expressed myself is inexcusable and is not the person I am. I see that my words and actions hurt people, and for that, I am deeply sorry. While people should be given the freedom to express themselves, they should do so calmly and with respect. What the video didn't show is the real me. I am not a racist."
"Some apps aim to change the world, while others are designed to bring beauty to your pocket gadget. Beautiful Clock Widgets falls into the latter category. This small Android app does exactly what it says on the label, offering a collection of clock widgets with the ability to add additional data, such as local weather and battery charge information. Some of them are cool, others are funny, and a few are just weird. It's worth noting that some of them are only available in the Pro version, which costs $1.26 or the equivalent in your local currency."

"It is not uncommon to read and hear complaints about the amount of waste generated by the two main parties, a phenomenon that seems to intensify during election campaigns. And yet, rarely do these two parties actively strive for real waste management. And by this, I mean a discussion of waste in the literal sense! And yet, the problem of waste and garbage in general is one that affects us all, touching on issues of public health, social cohesion, and tourism, among other things!"
"The city of Zamboanga - Horror has gripped the residents of Pata Island in Sulu, and it does not come from extremists, but from politicians. The residents have turned to the government for help to prevent another attack on their island community, which, according to one of them, was provoked by the residents' refusal to support the incumbent mayor, Anton Buruhan. ""We are powerless,"" said 60-year-old Bidin Jubail, a resident of Saimbangan, one of the villages on Pata Island. Jubail recalled the attack on the island town, allegedly carried out by Buruhan's followers on January 2, who were armed with an M203 grenade launcher and M-14 and M-16 rifles."
"Optimism among German businessmen has fallen to its lowest level in more than 2.5 years in October, the sixth consecutive decline, dispelling any remaining doubts that Europe's largest economy is now mired in the eurozone debt crisis.

This cozy home with a one-car garage sits on a 1.2-acre lot with perfect spots for a fire pit, surrounded by Adirondack-style chairs."
"The life of the mind baffles poets and neurobiologists who map it out and assign labels to it, and in my case, try to find it. The very thought of it is worth pondering in the Irish tradition, and therefore there are many concepts in the Irish language related to the mind, dreams, and imagination. I'm just a student, so many nuances will escape me, but language is conversation. I would love to hear how native speakers propose more complex thoughts about the lexicon of Irish thought."
"According to analysts, the market is entering a consolidation phase after the recent rally. NEW DEAL: The below-normal monsoon forecast made by private weather agency Skymet proved to be a major disappointment for stock indices on Wednesday, which lost their ground after hitting absolute highs. As per Skymet, the 2019 monsoon is likely to be ""below normal"" and will be 93% of the long period average (LPA) of 887 mm over four months, starting from June and ending in September. This led to a decrease in investor optimism, erasing previous gains, and the market ended the day in negative territory."

"LOS ANGELES – An attempt to grant subpoena power to the commission overseeing the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department will go to a vote in March 2020, after it failed to gain approval from the Board of Supervisors today. Proponents of the ""Los Angeles County Jail Reform"" initiative gathered nearly a quarter million signatures in support of the measure, which would also give the Civilian Oversight Commission a mandate to explore reducing the number of people incarcerated in the county's jails and redirecting funds from jail construction to alternative sentencing measures. Supervisor Sheila Kuehl stated that more of the county's 10 million residents should have a chance to weigh in on the issue."

"Israeli troops have wounded a Palestinian teenager at a checkpoint in the West Bank. Egypt is trying to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the Palestinian organization that de facto controls the Gaza Strip, in order to avoid an escalation of violence on the Gaza border. The airstrikes occurred shortly after Israeli forces killed a 16-year-old boy near the occupied city of Nablus in the West Bank. Michal Yaakov, a representative of the Israeli army, said that he saw a person behaving suspiciously at the Hawara checkpoint on Monday, which led soldiers to believe that he was armed with explosives."
"Ottawa, March 20 (Reuters) - In the latest blow to the government of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a lawmaker quit the ruling Liberal Party to sit as an independent on Wednesday after defending a former minister at the center of a political scandal. Trudeau has been on the defensive since February 7 over allegations that top officials in his office pressured former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to ensure that construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc escaped prosecution on corruption charges. The political crisis threatens the government's chances of re-election in elections scheduled for October this year."
"The Supreme Court on Friday asked the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) in Nagpur and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to consider the Agra Municipal Corporation's proposal to set up a waste-to-energy plant in the city.

This week, the East Bay Regional Park District issued a warning about sightings of rattlesnakes on park trails, now that it has warmed up. Jeff McKenzie was in the green zone near the mountain."
"The Grant Bar and Grill is a lively spot where local musicians play on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evenings, as well as Sunday during lunch on the outdoor patio. If the Old Fish House could talk, one can only imagine the fascinating stories it would tell about its 100 years of life by the Indian River Lagoon. It would tell us about the early days when entire families slept on their fishing boats. We would hear stories of the morning light on the river, when husbands took the same boats and joined the fishing fleet heading out to sea, while families stayed behind with the wives working tirelessly in the fish house, processing the fish."
"Washington, July 31, 2018 / 15:01. - The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) was justified in banning the Archdiocese of Washington's religious advertising, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled on Tuesday. In November 2015, WMATA published 14 new guidelines for acceptable advertising on buses and trains. Section 12 explicitly prohibited ""advertising that promotes or opposes any religion, religious practice or belief.""

"The US is implementing a plan to relocate Palestinians to the northern part of the Sinai Peninsula and transfer part of the West Bank to Israel. As President Donald Trump continues to create noise and write tweets, being in the chaos of his presidency, the situation in the Middle East is dangerously approaching a critical point.

"Maureen Wildes claims it's time to learn about the real impact of the Vietnam War on the children of veterans. Like many other children of veterans, I am also a statistic. If this research had been conducted many years ago, when it should have been conducted, maybe I would have understood what was happening to me, not to mention my father. Hello, I am the wife of a Vietnam War veteran, I have three daughters. My first daughter from my first marriage when I was 18, and the next two girls from my second marriage in 1970."
"Albany - Governor Andrew Cuomo, who has two Twitter accounts with more than 863,000 followers, called the popular social media site an ""elite bulletin board"" on Tuesday and said he doesn't look at it.

Cuomo has two Twitter accounts, one with 853,000 followers and another with 10,400. He said that during his campaign last year, his journalists advised him to follow events on Twitter."
"Less than two years ago, I was at a South Atlantic League (Low-A ball) game between the Hagerstown Suns and the visiting Greensboro Grasshoppers. The two Greensboro pitchers sitting behind me, Trevor Richards and Ben Meyer, were keeping a book on the game. As I mentioned in this post, neither of the pitchers seemed destined for the big leagues. Richards wasn't drafted in 2015 after graduating from a small college, so he had to start his career with the Gateway Grizzlies of the Frontier League, which is an independent league. The Miami Marlins signed him in 2016, and he performed well for Greensboro."
"The United Nations, August 26 - Amid an escalating propaganda campaign predicting US missile strikes on Syria, regardless of what the UN chemical weapons team finds in the Damascus suburbs, the question arises as to whether these strikes will be carried out while the UN team is still in the country. As for Syria, British and American officials have suggested that the investigation at this stage may be pointless, since Damascus has already been able to conceal some of the evidence. What does the United Nations hope to find as a result of this investigation? What actions is the UN prepared to take?"

"Undoubtedly, the addiction drama ""Beautiful Boy"" - and not the horror film ""Halloween"" - is the most disturbing movie opening this week. Starring Steve Carell (""Foxcatcher"") and Timothée Chalamet (""Call Me By Your Name""), the film is a mesmerizing and horrifying look at a young man's descent into methamphetamine addiction (and heroin, pills, marijuana, etc.) and a devoted father's attempts to save him. It's a true and terrifying story, so powerful that even an uninspired director and a formulaic script can't diminish its impact."

While many may think that proper nutrition and exercise are the keys to healthy aging, the International Journal of Psychogeriatrics found that certain personality traits can also have a huge impact on your life as you age. Every person has a busy life, but if you have recently moved a loved one into a nursing home or memory care cottage, it is even more important to stay connected with them. Nutrition is important for every person, but especially for the elderly."

They referred to a clause in the draft resolution welcoming the creation of South Sudan."
"There is no greater motivation for making peace than ratings and an upcoming contract negotiation. High above Midtown Manhattan, the leader of the Republican presidential pack and the evening news anchor met to settle their scores. Donald Trump and Megyn Kelly, who have publicly feuded for much of the election cycle, privately seething or ignoring each other, met at Trump Tower on Monday, apparently putting an end to the silence between them. ""Yes, it seemed the Swiss were a little shocked when I walked in,"" Kelly said on her Fox News show on Sunday night."
"Seabees from Naval Mobile Construction Battalion (NMCB) 7 and members of Alpha Company, 427th Brigade Support Battalion stand in formation during a transfer of authority ceremony at Camp Moreell in the Middle East May 23. The Seabees operated Camp Moreell, named after Admiral Ben Moreell, the ""Father of the Seabees"", as their main base and assembly point for nearly 10 years for many sailors who were deployed to serve in the Middle East before transferring duties to the Army. The main hub for deploying ""Seabees"" to Iraq and Afghanistan and back was closed during a ceremony held at Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait May 23."
"The University of Sri Jayewardenepura marked 60 years of excellence in higher education on 18 February 2019, reaching a significant milestone in its historic journey. The diamond jubilee will be celebrated with the participation of President Maithripala Sirisena, Chancellor, the venerable Dr Ittapane Dhammalankara, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Senior Professor Sampath Amaratunge and other dignitaries at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) on 2 April 2019. The University of Sri Jayewardenepura's rich and vibrant history - initially as Vidyodaya Pirivena - dates back to 1873."
"Magic is the best way to describe the championship win of the Litton College ""Hurricanes"" rugby academy in Levin. Only in their second year of existence, the under-15 girls' team, led by coach Trish Hina, defeated Wanganui 66-0, Feilding 42-0, and Kapiti 49-0 on the first day. On the second day, they beat a combined Wairarapa-Bush team 61-0 and Mana College 73-5, before thrashing Feilding 63-10 in the final. The Litton team was a cohesive unit, and over six games, they conceded just three tries. ""The girls have worked extremely hard to get to where they are now,"" Hina, a former New Zealand rugby player known as the Black Ferns, said."
"Vodafone has announced changes to its data roaming tariffs. These changes will be beneficial for light users who consume less than 5 MB of data per day while abroad. Starting from June 15, the daily network rate in Europe will be £1 per megabyte for the first 5 MB, and then £5 for every subsequent 5 MB. Outside of Europe, the rate will be £3 per megabyte for the first 5 MB, and then £15 for every subsequent 5 MB. These changes will be beneficial for those with minimal data requirements, but heavy users who require constant internet access will pay more for the privilege."
"PREBLE COUNTY — After two serious accidents involving young people in Preble County in the last week, Preble County Sheriff Mike Simpson discussed the issues of summer driving, when younger and less experienced drivers become more active on the roads during the summer months. According to Simpson, the roads often become more congested in the summer, and young drivers are more frequently on the roads since they are not in school. ""When kids are not in school or are coming home from college, there are a lot of young drivers on the roads driving back and forth to events or to work, since they are no longer spending 6-7 hours a day in school,"" Simpson said."
"The relatives of the deceased bravely listened as the circumstances of the death were revealed. Irritating details about how the victims of the helicopter crash in Clough died were limited at today's investigation into the fatal accident. This is stated in a joint protocol of agreement - a legal mechanism that means the prosecution and the other 14 legal parties to the investigation will not contest the details. Gary Arthur, 48, a sales consultant, was found in a pub, pinned under debris. He had no pulse when he was found by doctors. The forensic examination showed that he died from head injuries."
"The State Commission on Punishments in Correctional Institutions unanimously voted at a special meeting this morning to appoint interim Director Kevin Murphy as the permanent head of the Department of Correction. His existing salary of $123,380 will remain unchanged. Murphy was put in charge after Governor Asa Hutchinson fired Shelia Sharp due to questions about the adequacy of the state agency's parole conditions and behavioral supervision. Murphy has a complicated history in this position, having previously had a contract paid for by a non-profit organization working on behalf of the agency's employees, and also receiving a pension from the Department of Correction."
"Californians, more than anyone else, should understand what it means to displace people from their land. In the 1850s and 1860s, the state funded annual expeditions that ravaged entire areas where Native Americans lived. But this is not just a historical phenomenon: On the West Bank, Israeli settlers and the Israeli government have been trying for decades to eradicate the small Palestinian village of Susya. The village has existed near Hebron at least since the 19th century. In the 1980s, it was declared an archaeological site to allow settlers to move in and replace the former residents."
"Speaker Nabih Berri and the Syrian ambassador to Lebanon on Friday discussed the ""Israeli-Western schemes"" in the Syrian civil war, Berri's office reported. The Lebanese army on Friday set up a cordon in preparation for the demolition of an old arsenal found in the Sinik area of Saida. Lebanese workers staged 28 strikes and 121 protests in 2018, including strikes at the state-owned electricity company Electricite Du Liban and at the Lebanese University, a human rights monitor reported on Friday. An Iranian citizen was arrested in Beirut on charges of human trafficking and forging official documents, the Asharq al-Awsat newspaper reported on Friday."
"Every year, the police and government agencies ensure that Bangaloreans are warned in advance before Diwali to be safe. However, as in previous years, more than 60 firecracker-related injury incidents have already been recorded in the city this year. Shockingly, this year children between the ages of 4 and 14 suffered eye injuries due to negligence of fire safety measures. The city was filled with a festive atmosphere from Monday, but city hospitals collectively treated 60 firecracker victims. Additionally, starting from yesterday, local clinics in several residential areas have been attending to patients every hour."
"Bhubaneswar: Sashi Bhusan Behera, Minister of Finance and Excise, hopes that IOCL will participate in the Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) created for the development of PCPIR in Paradip, as well as in the Plastic Park in Paradip through equity participation. Moreover, IOCL needs to formulate an attractive raw material pricing mechanism to encourage the setting up of production units in Paradip. The state government has also approached the Ministry of Chemicals and Petrochemicals, Government of India, to provide budgetary support of at least Rs 3000 crore for undertaking necessary infrastructure development works in the region, said Shri Behera."
"A popular Belgian waffle franchise has opened its branch in Dubai with the support of the state agency for the development of small and medium-sized businesses. The Yummy Waffles cafe opened in Dubai Festival City on Sunday as part of a franchising agreement with Dubai SME, an agency of the Department of Economic Development responsible for the development of small and medium-sized businesses.

Avid's bins have been overhauled, and the software is now equipped with task-oriented workspaces that display only the elements a user needs to accomplish a specific task."
"An oncology expert has discovered a way to kill tumors in just two hours - using light. The method involves a one-time introduction of a chemical substance, followed by a burst of ultraviolet radiation. It has been found that cancer cells in laboratory mice self-destruct, with up to 95 percent of cells dying within two hours. Professor Matthew Gdovin revealed that the cells he introduced with the chemical compound nitrobenzaldehyde became too acidic to survive. He said after patenting his ""photodynamic"" therapy: ""There are many different types of cancer. One of the common characteristics is their susceptibility to this induced cell self-destruction."""
"Unmanned aerial vehicles are released today in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, but overall, most of them still belong to one of two categories. There are those that belong to the type of multi-rotor (quadcopters, hexacopters, octacopters, etc.), and those that belong to the type of winged. Each category has its own advantages and disadvantages. Multi-rotor devices are usually more stable and easier to control, but also much slower than winged drones, which are focused on accelerating forward. On the other hand, winged drones can fly faster and farther than their hovering counterparts, but are more complex to control, as they cannot perform vertical takeoffs and landings."
"BASEL, Switzerland – Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche Holding AG said on Monday it had received reports of 13 cases in which the H1N1 flu virus had become resistant to its Tamiflu drug, which the company considered a very low percentage. A good sign was that people with the resistant form had not transmitted the disease to others, said David Reddy, the head of Roche's Tamiflu pandemic task force. And the resistant variant was similar to the widely spread version of the virus in that it usually caused only mild symptoms. The 13 cases were recorded worldwide in Europe, the US, and Asia, Reddy said."
"Russian President Vladimir Putin called the downing of a Russian fighter jet by Turkish military today (November 24) ""a stab in the back from the accomplices of terrorists"", stating that the incident would have serious consequences. Speaking at the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi on Tuesday before a meeting with King Abdullah of Jordan, Putin said the downed plane was attacked over Syria while it was just 1 kilometer away from the Turkish border and crashed 4 kilometers inside Syria. This contradicts Turkey's statement that the plane had repeatedly been warned it was entering Turkish airspace before it was shot down."
"Arsene Wenger believes the return to training of English forward Theo Walcott and the impending recovery of German player Lukas Podolski means that Arsenal are not under extra pressure to buy another striker in January. The Gunners resume domestic competition on Saturday, looking to respond to the 1-0 defeat by Manchester United with a win over third-placed Southampton to stay top of the Barclays Premier League. Walcott is likely to play against his former club after about two months out with a stomach problem that required surgery. Podolski, meanwhile, is on course to be available again by the end of December after not playing since 27 August due to a hamstring injury."
"The New York Knicks are approaching the quarter mark of the calendar with a mediocre 9-9 record, seeking to end a 43-year championship drought. Coach Jeff Hornacek and the Knicks will have the upper hand against their opponents in December. Of the 15 games they will play this month, only five will be against teams with a positive record. They will host the 5-13 Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday. Joakim Noah, Derrick Rose, and Carmelo Anthony may be the most notable names on the roster, but they are not living up to expectations. Anthony's team-high 22.2 points per game is slightly higher than last season."
"The Hashemite Library remained a beacon of knowledge and a destination for readers and intellectuals until 2000, when the number of readers began to decline due to the difficult economic situation in the Gaza Strip. In the 1950s, the Hashemite Library received orders for the sale of newspapers and books from prominent Egyptian publishers and distributors. It was also a space for writers and intellectuals to meet. However, the emergence of the Internet and the poverty of the residents of the Gaza Strip hindered these activities. ""Due to the rise of the Internet and economic stagnation, we no longer received books for distribution or sale."
"Google has had a tense relationship with China for a long time, and the search giant has largely retreated from the Chinese market after stating that state-backed hackers had targeted its systems and employees. A forthcoming book by chairman Eric Schmidt, ""The New Digital Age"", is unlikely to improve the situation, judging by a description of the work in the Wall Street Journal, which has seen galleries of the not-yet-released book. ""In this global internet, China, the book repeatedly argues, is the most dangerous and threatening superpower,"" Tom Gara writes."
"Ray Trew has stepped down as chairman of Notts County and announced that the League Two club is up for sale. Trew became owner and chairman in 2010, but said he had made the decision after his family had been subjected to ""abhorrent and mindless abuse"" in recent days. Notts, who appointed Jamie Fullarton as manager in January, are 16th in League Two, having been relegated from the top division last season. According to BBC Radio Nottingham, local businessman Alan Hardy is in talks to buy the club. ""With very mixed emotions, I announce the end of my tenure,"" Trew wrote in an open letter to fans."
"Warning: the video above contains graphic images. SODUS, N.Y. (WHEC) -- A new management team promised changes, but complaints about care and conditions inside the Sodus Rehabilitation and Nursing Center continue to surface. News10NBC has been investigating this facility and its reputation for over a year, and although leadership was replaced last summer, families continue to face serious safety concerns inside. Joy Ann Mitchell-Kinley was under the care of Father Bill Tanner, since her father and Bill Tanner were best friends, and when her father passed away, Bill took Joy Ann under his wing."
"Do you want to put an end to the war on whistleblowers? Revise the Espionage Act. Over the past 100 years, this law has turned into a tool of state secrecy. The evolution of the Espionage Act has made a significant contribution to the formation of freedom of political discussions in modern America. What began as a vague law giving President Woodrow Wilson the right to arrest critics and censor the media during World War I, has turned into a powerful law regulating political discussions through control over secrets, rather than speech. Censorship did not end with the end of the war. It evolved. Despite its name, the Espionage Act has always been a broad law."
"Google is trying to save presentation audiences from having to listen to long, rambling questions with a new feature it added to its Slides software on Wednesday. Slides Q&A allows audiences to submit text questions over the internet while listening to a presentation using Google's software. As the speaker talks, she can see the questions and answer them without waiting for someone to make their way to a microphone. The view in Google Slides Q&A allows speakers to see what their audience wants to know. In addition to submitting questions, audience members can also vote on the questions they want to hear answered."
"Manfred Weber (41) is the newly elected chairman of the European People's Party (EPP), the largest political group in the European Parliament after the 2014 elections. He represents the conservative Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) in Germany. Weber spoke with Dario Sarmadi from EURACTIV Germany. David Cameron wants the UK to leave the EU if Jean-Claude Juncker becomes President of the European Commission. What would you say to the British Prime Minister? The UK belongs in the EU - and is stronger within the community itself."
"When Conservative Party leader William Hague strolled through a crowd of devoted supporters at a dinner rally on Tuesday, and the host introduced the ""next Prime Minister of Britain"", even many of his supporters couldn't stifle an involuntary laugh. The conservative London newspaper The Times for the first time in its history backed the Labour Party, endorsing Prime Minister Tony Blair for a second term. The country's largest bookmaker, Ladbrokes, had already stopped taking bets on Thursday's upcoming election and begun paying out winnings on bets for a Labour Party victory."
"April 24, 2014, 10:30 am.
A few smart news companies are seeing growth in digital advertising and smart strategy. But most newspaper companies are coming to the conclusion that key metrics are still moving in the wrong direction. Ken Doctor @kdoctor April 24, 2014, 10:30 am.
As we approach the mid-2010s, where are newspapers in the battle for America's largest advertising sector - digital? And how well are all those paywalls working? Two reports have become public in recent weeks, and together they help answer both questions."
"From the M1917 to the M1A2, American tanks have dominated the battlefield. The US Army and Marine Corps are on the cusp of a centennial anniversary - 100 years of tanks in American service. This animated GIF, compiled by people from partcatalog.com, shows the evolution of the American tank - from the fragile light tank M1917 to the M1A2 Abrams - and demonstrates how the US transformed from a novice in the world of tanks to a world leader. The M1917 light tank, for example, was simply a copy of the Renault FT-17. Such an approach to copying engineering would be unthinkable now."
"The first of such groups to be named was the Bajrang Dal, whose activist burned alive Australian missionary Graham Staines, along with his two minor sons in Orissa in 1999. This heart-wrenching incident is cited as an early example of saffron terror in India. The ugly face of Hindutva terror came to the fore again after the arrest of three persons in Maharashtra for their alleged involvement in a conspiracy to carry out ""terrorist acts"" in different parts of the state. According to the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), 22 items were seized from the accused's house in Pune."
"Meet Ron Brown from AAG Archaeology with a toilet door from a street toilet. Below is a photograph of a Westoe street toilet. The toilet door, found in a historic building in South Tyneside, now occupies a place of honour in one of the North East's most popular tourist attractions. During a survey of the Regent City House on Beach Road in South Shields, staff from North East-based AAG Archaeology discovered what may be the only street toilet door to have made it into a museum collection. It was the eagle eye of archaeologist Ron Brown that spotted what is believed to be the best preserved example of a classic North East street toilet door protruding from the rubble of a demolished toilet."
"The best part of M. Night Shyamalan's 2017 film ""Split"" - and one of the few things he got right - occurred right at the end. A brief, stunning revelation featuring Bruce Willis reprising his role as David Dunn from ""Unbreakable"", created a shared universe that Shyamalan was all too eager to capitalize on. Unfortunately, there's a big difference between winning over fans with a momentary cameo and building a story around it. ""Glass"", the third film in what has become a trilogy, feels like a collection of underformed ideas mixed into an uneven blend."

"Sign the RootsAction petition to mayors and police chiefs across the country affirming your support for the right to indefinite peaceful protest. The Occupy Wall Street protesters scored a major victory on Friday when Mayor Bloomberg and Brookfield Properties, the owners of New York's Zuccotti Park, backed down from demands that protesters temporarily leave the park for cleaning and subsequent adherence to new rules banning sleeping bags, most equipment, and even lying down. Protesters in many other cities have not been so lucky."
"Products of Progressive Networks, RealAudio and RealVideo for streaming, got an impulse for development today, as it was announced that Microsoft plans to acquire a minority stake in the company and license its key products, RealAudio and RealVideo 4.0. As part of the agreement, Microsoft will integrate Progressive's technologies into Internet Explorer clients and the NetShow streaming server, and the companies will cooperate to ensure compatibility of their server and client products. In turn, Progressive will support Microsoft's Active Streaming Format (ASF) as well as its own file formats, and will use Microsoft's DirectShow and DirectDraw APIs, as well as other technologies in future versions of its Windows clients."
"ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) - Mike Minor achieved what no left-hander could, returning to the starting rotation last season for the Texas Rangers team. The Angels won only 2 games out of 14 on the road since September, while at home they won 12 out of 14. ... The Rangers hit a home run in all 10 home games, which is their longest home streak in the season in Texas history. ... This was the second shutout of the season for Texas, both at home, after they had only one home shutout last season."

By moving protection to the network level, Box products protect all devices on the network, including refrigerators, game consoles, and security cameras."
"Technology company leaders are discussing the impact of automation technologies on their organizations. For many organizations and their employees, technological automation is both an opportunity and a threat. On one hand, the use of automation, robotic process automation, and other tools creates efficiency by automating manual and repetitive tasks. On the other hand, it has the potential to make jobs redundant. Technology company leaders recently gathered for roundtable discussions in Sydney and Melbourne to discuss the impact of automation technologies on their organizations. One of the key issues raised during the discussion was the challenge of ensuring compliance with policy and governance procedures when replacing human-performed tasks with ""bots"" across the company."
"Baceapp Corporation and LightSpin Technologies Inc. will be moving into Binghamton University's engineering and science facility. The two companies plan to create 39 jobs and invest $540,000 over the next five years while being in Binghamton University's tax-free zones, as announced by Governor Andrew Cuomo on Monday. Baceapp Corporation and LightSpin Technologies Inc., which will be moving into Binghamton University's engineering and science facility, were two of the 17 companies introduced on Monday as new participants in the Start-Up NY program, which offers 10 years of tax freedom in locations near or on college campuses."
"WASHINGTON, March 1 - After a year in which a record number of billion-dollar disasters were recorded, representatives of leading insurance companies stated today that expenses for taxpayers and businesses due to extreme weather conditions will continue to grow due to climate change. Insurers joined Senators Bernie Sanders (Independent - Vermont) and Sheldon Whitehouse (Democrat - Rhode Island) at a press conference to discuss the growing financial impact of global warming. Both Vermont and Rhode Island were affected by Tropical Storm Irene in August of last year, one of 14 record-breaking disasters in the US last year, each of which caused damage exceeding $1 billion."
"This was another quarter of rapid growth for the optical equipment manufacturer, but shares fell as investors remained uninspired by the revenue forecast. Infinera (NASDAQ:INFN) released its Q1 results on April 27 after the market closed. Although the results were slightly above the company's own forecast, traders sold shares throughout Thursday's trading session as the company predicted growth would slow in the next quarter. By 3:40 p.m., shares had fallen nearly 24% from the previous close. Let's take a closer look at the results to see how the company performed in three areas that I think investors should focus on."
"Edgar Wright has never made a bad film, he hasn't even made a film that's just good, and so it's completely logical that at this point in his career Wright has avoided direct sequels. However, this may soon change with the release of the film ""Baby Driver"". When ""Shaun of the Dead"" had huge success, rather than using it as a springboard to create a zombie sequel, Wright, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost created a thematically linked trilogy of films - the Cornetto Trilogy - along with the also excellent ""Hot Fuzz"" and ""The World's End""."
"The TTP apparently failed to fund its activities due to a lack of money. ISLAMABAD: The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has been facing a severe financial crisis since its slain founder Baitullah Mehsud united several disparate groups from all corners of the tribal territory to form the deadliest terrorist network of local militants in 2007. ""The Taliban have seriously depleted their financial resources... they have almost no money left,"" said at least three associates of the group against the backdrop of the surprising lull in their activities - blasts and attacks across Pakistan and in some parts of Afghanistan - over the past few months."
"In the third quarter of 2018, luxury home prices rose 3.2% year over year, to a median sale price of $1.7 million, according to the latest data from Redfin. Redfin defines luxury homes as those that were sold among the top 5% most expensive in the quarter. The company reported that sales of homes priced at $2 million or more increased for the ninth consecutive time. However, this is the lowest growth rate since the beginning of 2016. Additionally, the number of homes for sale priced at $2 million or more decreased by 6% compared to the previous year."

"The Chief Financial Officers Council reported last month that the Small Business Administration needs to improve the planning of its new database. The Small Business Administration had planned to introduce the Electronic Loan Processing and Information System (ELIPS), which is used to track government loans for small businesses online last week, but the Chief Financial Officers Council stated that the agency had not demonstrated that the project is a good investment. The Small Business Administration said it did not have time to complete the analysis required by the Clinger-Cohen Act because Congress required the system to be introduced by June 30. The US Army Materiel Command has published guidelines for improving teamwork between agencies and contractors."
"Surinamese intelligence agencies. Photo by Sanoesie101, Wikipedia. Location of Surinam. Source: CIA World Factbook. In 1980, a group of junior officers (sergeants) led by Dési Delano Bouterse overthrew the elected government, despite fierce resistance from the poorly armed police, who were only suppressed after the fleet bombarded them and forced them to surrender. This led to the establishment of a de facto military dictatorship (although a civilian president formally existed) in the country for the next seven years, led by Sergeant-Major (self-promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel) Dési Delano Bouterse."
"The Lifetime channel has announced that it will show a film about the relationship between Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown. And the network has done everything to invite a veteran actress who starred with the singer in the film ""Waiting to Exhale"" to the post of director of the biographical film. Angela Bassett, 55, is to make her directorial debut in the TV movie, which will focus on the late pop star who died in 2012. Lifetime announced that the film will tell the story of Houston and Brown from their first meeting to their tumultuous marriage. It also promises to tell the story of the singer's rise to fame with the song ""I Will Always Love You""."
"For the first time I heard these verses in a small temple located in a store in Kiev, Ukraine. I remember it because it was on the same Sunday that the tragic death of Princess Diana was reported. I had recently quit my job on Wall Street and was living in Kiev with my mother after my father had passed away, and I was there because I was having a hard time finding my way forward. I remember the wooden paneling on the walls of the room where I sat in the back, feeling a bit embarrassed by the enthusiasm of my fellow evangelists. But when I heard these verses, my wandering mind returned."
"She grew up in a predominantly white, working-class neighborhood. ""We were the only black people, and I was regularly called racist names,"" she recalls. ""Lying in bed, I prayed and asked for children to be kind to me and to others."" ""That led me to have 'rainbow friends' - Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Rastafarians, and Christians. I always wanted to connect with the heart and soul of people, regardless of faith or culture."""
"Getty Images photographer John Moore will receive the Impact Award from the Lucie Awards program on Sunday at Carnegie Hall in New York. These awards honor outstanding achievements in photography. Moore will join eight other honorees who will be recognized for their work at the awards ceremony. This is not the first award for the photojournalist, who grew up in Irving and graduated from the University of Texas at Austin. He has already received the 2005 Pulitzer Prize for News Photography, two awards from the Overseas Press Club, and the title of ""Photographer of the Year"" from Pictures of the Year International, as well as other awards."
"Guess what? The NBA is actually show business. Only super producer David Stern doesn't pull all the strings from behind the scenes (otherwise the ""New York"" would have somehow won the draft lottery). On the contrary, the league moves like an extremely expensive and uncontrollable Hollywood production - driven by the egos of big players, full of stunning plot twists, prone to endless rewrites. And to think: we haven't even mentioned the ""Los Angeles Lakers"" yet. Unfortunately, the biggest news of the season has nothing to do with basketball."
"Doug Newcomb 2015 Lincoln MKC If you want a stylish, affordable luxury crossover that's an alternative to the usual imports, the 2015 Lincoln MKC is a compelling choice. Relatively affordable price. Wide range of driver assistance systems. Quiet cabin. Outdated infotainment interface. Less lively engine compared to competitors. If you want a stylish, affordable luxury crossover that's an alternative to the usual imports, the 2015 Lincoln MKC is a compelling choice. Although Ford is setting sales records and making money hand over fist, its luxury car division Lincoln is largely lagging behind the competition."
"NASA is going to lower a small robot into a volcano in Hawaii to map its internal data and geographical features, such as cracks and volcanic ventilation shafts. A similar robot is already exploring the volcano. ""We don't know exactly how volcanoes erupt. We have models, but they're all very, very simplified. This project is aimed at making those models more realistic,"" said Carolyn Parcheta, a postdoctoral researcher based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, according to NASA. The NASA-developed robot can climb in places where humans are not allowed."
"Hearst Magazines will be busy in 2018, completing its acquisition of Rodale, buying some magazines in the Netherlands and increasing the frequency of two of its last remaining titles. The Pioneer Woman Magazine, a partnership with blogger and Food Network star Ree Drummond, published two sold-out issues in 2017 and will double its frequency to four issues in 2018, as Hearst Magazines President David Carey told employees in a year-end letter. This is a good opportunity for Airbnb, which tried to launch its own magazine called Pineapple in 2014, but it only lasted one issue."

"The daughter of a Kannada tabloid editor, arrested for allegedly hiring a hitman to kill a fellow journalist, claimed today that her father is ""not guilty"" and will ""safely"" come out of the case. Ravi Belagere, who publishes the tabloid Hi Bangalore, was arrested yesterday from his home for allegedly hiring a ""supari"" killer from Vijayapura in north Karnataka to kill Sunil Heggaravalli. ""No one has filed a complaint in this case based on anyone's statement. This case was registered by the police on their own initiative based on the statement of Shailesh (the hitman)""."
"Manatees are large, grey, aquatic mammals. They have thick bodies - I think ""full figures"" is how clothing companies try to convince manatees to buy larger jeans - that taper to a flat, paddle-like tail. Adult manatees typically reach lengths of about 3 metres and weigh between 360 and 540 kilograms. Manatees are one of the ugliest of God's oceanic creations, and there are plenty of weird sea creatures. These are facts - the remark about ugliness is an opinion, but it's obvious enough to be considered a fact - that I learned from the Save the Manatee Club website."

"A French woman who received the world's first partial face transplant presented her new look to the public on Monday, speaking in a raspy voice that she now looks ""like everyone else"" and hopes to return to a normal life. Isabelle Dinoire's speech was difficult to understand, but she explained how she was disfigured by a dog bite last year, and she thanked the donor family who gave her new lips, chin, and nose. A thin, circular scar was still visible where the facial tissue was transplanted during the 15-hour operation in Amiens on November 27."
"Did Donald Trump release Donald Trump's tax return? For a moment, it seemed like Rachel Maddow had gotten a huge sensational story. And then, suddenly, everything changed…. Thanks to MSNBC, the assumption that Trump ""paid no taxes for 18 years"" turned out to be false. Moreover, Trump apparently paid a higher tax rate in 2005 than most politicians, and, in addition, had a pretty big income. It is unknown whether the journalistic work was selectively edited."
"MAUT PLEASANT, Sanpete County - education officials are asking students without current vaccinations to stay home for a few weeks as Sanpete County deals with a mumps outbreak. According to a statement from North Sanpete School District Superintendent Dr. Sam Ray, there have been two confirmed cases of mumps in Sanpete County. One of them is a school district student, he said. Another potential case of mumps is currently under investigation, and health officials are awaiting test results, Ray said. Ray did not say which school the student with mumps attends, but stated that North Sanpete Middle School is the ""epicenter"" of the outbreak."
"In hard times, creative bakers turned to desperation pies: salt and vinegar pie and green tomato pie are not usually on the list of favorite American sweets. But in Depression-era America, these and other desperation pies that have survived to this day demonstrate the resourcefulness of home cooks. Some desperation pies, like the green tomato pie, still enjoy niche success today. Imagine yourself as a resourceful farmer during the Great Depression. You want to make a dessert for your family, but traditional pie ingredients, such as cherries or pecans, are too expensive or unavailable."
"There is a Speed Graphic camera, once standard equipment in newsrooms across the country. You may have seen them in movies from the 1930s and 40s, where groups of photographers wore ""Press"" badges in fedoras. Heavy, clumsy, and requiring flashbulbs the size of light bulbs to shoot at night, the Speed Graphic was the first camera I used professionally, for my high school yearbook and the newspaper I worked part-time at while in high school and college. The one that sits in my office used sheet film - you took a shot, pulled out the film holder, and inserted another."
"Everyone who has ever experienced frustration from shooting video in low light should be excited about the strange and wonderful new camera from Canon. It's a video camera that shoots full HD video in almost complete darkness. The ""multi-purpose"" camera, dubbed the MH20F-SH, features a full-frame sensor with 2.26 megapixels. The reason for the modest resolution is that each pixel is very large — a full 19 microns. This is 7.5 times larger than, say, the pixels found in a top DSLR like the Canon 1Dx."
"Is our efficient tax office killing this country? I have never seen a story where the Reserve Bank has called on the government to offer tax breaks, but that's what's happening now, which partly explains why our economy is going backwards. In fact, the result of this historically unusual story is that the tax commissioner, Chris Jordan, and his team are doing a great job of identifying excessive claims for deductions, particularly by businesses. Thanks to productivity gains from computer technology, the country's tax revenues are increasing."
"A facilities operations manager wears many hats. It's not uncommon for a facilities operations manager to hold a meeting, offer plumbing advice, present a renovation project, and ensure proper floor cleaning - all in one day. Facilities operations managers consider the safety and health of all building users, understanding how the facility operates. To be a successful facilities operations manager, a strong foundation in management, technical skills, basic construction knowledge, and technology is necessary. The facilities operations manager is responsible for overseeing the physical infrastructure of a building or structural campus."
"A communications professor at Texas A&M University wanted to know about the effects of changes in the newspaper industry on our national politics, so she conducted some research that was published in the Journal of Communication. If you've noticed that it seems like there's been a sharp rise in political polarization over the past few years, you're not imagining it. And, as Joanna Dunaway and some colleagues from the Universities of Colorado and Louisiana found, that polarization has occurred during a period of steady decline in the number of local newspapers and journalists across the country."
"WASHINGTON -- An Iowa egg producer at the center of a national salmonella outbreak apologized to a congressional committee on Wednesday and acknowledged that the family business ""grew too fast."" ""What I mean by that is we grew too fast before we started implementing the complex procedures to ensure we were meeting all of the government requirements,"" egg producer Austin J. DeCoster told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee. He is the founder of an empire that over three decades has been linked to several deadly salmonella outbreaks in multiple states."
"A Conservative council candidate was expelled from the party after failing to declare his unpaid drink-driving conviction for which he was later convicted. Ben Wong, 48, of the South Dragon House restaurant on Silver Street, was standing in the Victoria ward election on May 2 under the Conservative flag but was expelled after his conviction. The nomination deadline was April 3, but he appeared before Taunton magistrates on March 21 - which was unknown to Somerset Conservatives."
"Batfleck is officially no more. Ben Affleck has officially stepped down from his role as Bruce Wayne in the Batman film. And he's passing the torch to a new actor, who has yet to be confirmed. Warner Bros. announced the official release date for the film ""Batman"" earlier today, and the DC adventure film is set to hit theaters on June 25, 2021. Shortly after the news broke, Ben Affleck took to social media to wish director Matt Reeves good luck in taking the caped crusader into the future. The tweet was later confirmed as Ben Affleck's farewell to the character."
"When people dine at a restaurant, it's customary to leave a tip, but one particular charge for ordering a milkshake and fries at a New Jersey diner has outraged parents. ""My daughter would come home and tell me that every time she and her friends went to the diner, they were forced to pay a tip,"" said Melissa Desh. ""And when I asked her why, she said: 'Because they're kids'."" Desh said her daughter, Isabella, and other Schuyler-Colfax Middle School students often go to the Wayne Hills Diner, located just across the Hamburg Turnpike from the school."
"DALLAS - Like many Americans, Martin Jakobson was thrilled when U.S. Navy SEALs captured and killed Osama bin Laden. But the Dallas resident felt a deeper connection to the people who tracked down the mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Several decades ago, he was one of them. During World War II, Jakobson was part of an elite group that was a forerunner to the Navy SEALs. The secretive service is accustomed to staying out of the spotlight, but they're back in the spotlight after the bin Laden killing. ""I'm just proud of the SEALs,"" said Jakobson, 89."
"Today, Northern Ireland was named the capital of racial hatred in Europe in a report on racial violence in the province. Doreen Lawrence, a human rights activist and the mother of murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence, arrived in Belfast to launch the report by the Northern Ireland Council for Ethnic Minorities (NICEM). The report identified institutional racism in the justice system and questioned how it can be reduced. Racial violence has been increasing in Northern Ireland in recent years, and not just against black and Asian people, but almost against anyone who is perceived as different."
"About 300 residents of Kandal province, involved in land disputes with private companies, delivered petitions to embassies in Phnom Penh yesterday and then held a protest in front of the provincial council building, calling on Prime Minister Hun Sen to help them. Village residents told the newspaper that they want to put an end to the land disputes caused by companies that ""took their land"", adding that they are ""ready to die"" rather than go home without a result. They stated that the authorities are ignoring their requests for help, while the companies are using the judicial system to arrest village residents who complain about the land seizures."
"Incline bench training is a weight training exercise that targets the upper chest muscles and the front deltoids. The exercise is performed by lying on an incline bench, then grasping dumbbells or a barbell over the body and extending and flexing the elbows to lift the weight over the chest. Incline bench press machines, which mimic the movement in a fixed plane, are another way to perform the exercise. Incline bench training is one of several exercises that help create symmetry and strength in the muscles of the upper body."
"Jürgen Klopp expressed his satisfaction at ending Pep Guardiola's 22-match unbeaten run with Manchester City, exclaiming live on air: ""What was that?!"" And the Liverpool manager also hit back at critics targeting his vulnerable defence, adding: ""Get the boots off me!"" Klopp was ecstatic after masterminding a thrilling 4-3 win over the league leaders at Anfield this morning. The second half was a real onslaught as Liverpool quickly went 4-1 up before City scored two late goals to create a nervy finish."
"No one asked me, but... if you pay dues to a neo-Nazi organization, subscribe to racist publications, buy tickets to a Holocaust denial conference, and have a Holocaust denial DVD in your video collection, you're probably a neo-Nazi. That doesn't mean you'll be a neo-Nazi forever. You can change your mind and thoughts, and reform. If you want people to believe you're no longer a neo-Nazi, you'll have to prove a lot. Shedding the brown shirt takes a lot of work."
"The first sign of redemption for Brent Moloney after his post-game binge came mid-season when he was quietly reinstated into the club's leadership group. The second, far more public and significant than the first, came last night when he won Melbourne's best and fairest award. Moloney, 27, took out the Keith 'Bluey' Truscott Trophy, edging out key defenders Jared Rivers and James Frawley at the Crown Palladium ceremony. Two of Moloney's on-field midfield partners, Nathan Jones and Jack Trengove, finished fourth and fifth respectively."
"The Weeknd will team up with Daft Punk for a performance at the Grammy Awards. LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Weeknd will team up with Daft Punk for a performance at the Grammy Awards. The joint performance by the singer and the electronic music duo is one of several announced on Tuesday. Anderson .Paak will take the stage with A Tribe Called Quest and Dave Grohl. Maren Morris is set to perform with Alicia Keys. The Grammys had previously announced that Adele, John Legend, Bruno Mars, Metallica, Carrie Underwood, and Keith Urban will also perform."
"DARTMOUTH - On June 14, Flag Day, the students of the James M. Quinn Elementary School in Dartmouth gathered outside to celebrate Flag Day. In itself, this was not unusual, but this year it took on a more personal meaning. The reason for this was that Dr. Carol Karadontis' cousin, Ted Cot of New Bedford, is serving in Iraq. Earlier this year, around Veterans Day, Dr. Karadontis had asked her students to send cards to Sergeant Cot to boost his morale. The students responded and made cards, which were then sent to Iraq."
"Will UBS Wealth Management be led by Bob McCann or Sallie Krawcheck. Former Merrill Lynch brokerage head Bob McCann and former Citigroup wealth management head Sallie Krawcheck are both being considered as possible leaders of UBS Wealth Management. Investment News reported that two industry recruiters stated that both names ""are already being discussed"". Earlier, the Financial Times reported that new UBS CEO Oswald Grübel had decided not to sell the company's US wealth management business, despite speculation in recent months that he might sell the business following tax evasion charges and subsequent scandal."
"If the US presidential election were to be decided through social media, then Barack Obama would clearly have won this year against the Republican candidate Mitt Romney. The Obama team actively uses social media, and the president has a huge advantage in the number of followers on Facebook and Twitter, and one of the structures of the National Democratic Committee uses private social media tools to communicate with some campaign staff. There is also evidence that the Obama team is using social media analytics to gauge voter sentiment and track the popularity of campaign messages. None of the campaigns contacted to discuss social media strategies responded to messages."
"Let's take a moment to define what impact investing is. Great! Now that they're gone, we can get down to business. For over four years, I've covered impact investing as a regular Forbes contributor and written hundreds of articles on the subject. Here's the thing: most impact investments are only open to high net worth individuals. This impact investing guide is for everyone else, the 98% of the population that isn't allowed to invest alongside the wealthy."
"Health authorities have issued another measles warning after a person who was on public transport visited two universities and a food store while they were infectious. This is the fourth warning in recent weeks. The latest person to contract measles visited several public places between Sunday, January 7, and Wednesday, January 30. On January 30: on a train from Aubin Grove to Perth between 10:25-11:15 am, and from Canning Bridge to Mandurah between 2:20-3:15 pm.

"Sunny weather is expected today as high pressure sets in for the weekend. After a cool start, temperatures will rise into the upper 40s and lower 50s. A cool evening is expected under mostly clear skies. Lows will be in the upper 20s and lower 30s. The wind will be blowing from the south tomorrow, which means we will see milder temperatures. Expect highs in the upper 50s. Some communities may reach 60. However, thicker clouds develop during the day. It appears that the clouds will clear out at night with lows in the upper 30s and lower 40s."
"It was a post-earthquake scene. A sea of orange boxes was scattered all over the floor, shoes were stuck in every crevice, and stunned people stood in shock. But it wasn't a disaster. It was Black Friday at a Nike store in Seattle. Terrified shoppers at the Seattle Premium Outlets mall in Tulalip, Washington, posted photos and videos of the horrific state of the store after the holiday weekend. They show people carelessly stepping on boxes protecting Nike sneakers, bursting through the store and mindlessly grabbing and throwing shoes along their way."
"The 27th annual Franti Southwest Iowa Balloon Days is taking place this week in Creston. Balloon Committee representative Bill Fastenow says wind is the determining factor on whether the balloons will fly and, of course, where they will end up. Fastenow says there will be a pilots meeting today (Saturday) at 4:30 pm, followed by a ""night glow"" at the Creston airport south of town, which he says is quite a sight. Creston Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Ellen Gerhart says at least 57 aeronauts have registered to participate in this week's events."

"The unemployment rate in Stark County fell to 6.8 percent in August, the lowest since September 2008. For the first time since 2008, Stark County's unemployment rate dipped below 7 percent, and several factors likely contributed to the decline. The prime suspect is the influx of businesses to the area due to the oil and natural gas drilling in the Utica Shale. Oilfield companies moved into the area, followed by engineering and construction firms providing various services. The manufacturing sector also experienced growth due to increased local and national demand for steel and drilling equipment."
"A horror movie star will visit one of the scariest places in Gaston County on Wednesday and Thursday. Actor Derek Mears, who has appeared in the films ""Friday the 13th"" (2009), ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"", ""Predators"", and ""Men in Black II"", will meet horror fans at a place called the ""Abandoned Mill"" in Belmont. Kevin Blanchfield, the mill's owner, said he tries to offer something new and interesting every year at the location. He expects the appearance of ""Friday the 13th"" character Jason Voorhees to boost weekday attendance. The mill usually draws around 200-300 people on weekday evenings before Halloween."
"WASHINGTON (Alliance News) - The price of gold remained stable on Thursday after the Federal Reserve's latest report on the state of the economy showed that businesses across the US had become less optimistic in recent months. The spot price of gold rose 0.2% to $1,294.11 per ounce, while the price of US gold futures was virtually unchanged at $1,293.75 per ounce. As economic concerns intensify, the Federal Reserve is expected to keep current interest rates at least until June. The dollar halted its recent gains on Thursday, and the pound stabilized after UK Prime Minister Theresa May won a vote of confidence in parliament and urged lawmakers to break the deadlock in the Brexit agreement."
"President Jacob Zuma believes that the State Capture report, presented by the Public Protector, is a political tool designed to be used against certain individuals. In an exclusive interview with ANN7 on Monday evening, Zuma spoke out about the State Capture report compiled by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela, in which she recommended that Zuma appoint a commission of inquiry into State Capture and that Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng choose a judge to lead it. The report investigated whether Zuma's friends - the scandalously known Gupta family - had undue influence over the executive."
"Why We Love It: Few things can compare in style to a good night's rest. Waking up in the morning feeling refreshed and full of energy is all thanks to a good night's sleep. One of the key factors that contribute to quality sleep may be a good mattress. The new mattress, available in sizes from full to California king, consists of five layers of ""premium"" foam, including a one-inch ""flo"" foam, a 1.5-inch latex foam, a 1.5-inch viscoelastic memory foam, a 1.5-inch high-resilience foam, and gel-support pillows, among other things."
"Jenna Barker of Seton Catholic set a sectional record by winning the 1600 meters in 5 minutes, 13.04 seconds, and also won the 800 meters as several local athletes qualified for regionals during the IHSAA girls track sectional Tuesday at Connersville High School. Other individual sectional champions included Richmond's Riley Austin in the 200 meters and long jump, Richmond's Nakala Bennett in the 100 meters, Seton Catholic's Hannah Stamm in the 3200 meters, and Austin, Lindsey Griffin, Peyton Vannoy, and Riley Wetzel of Richmond in the 4x400 relay."
"When the theme of the congress seemed to be ""Drill, baby, drill"", which is an energy policy just as ""Tax, baby, tax"" is a fiscal policy (i.e. it doesn't exist), the slogans seem to be all the party has left. Even if you think that increasing oil exploration and drilling by drilling on the shelf makes sense, you can't take these people seriously. Unfortunately, you can. This moment, by the way, was the moment when I became completely disillusioned with congress."
"The new chairman of the National Children's Hospital board has stated that it would be ""wrong"" for the State to allow the hospital's main contractor to avoid its obligations. Board chairman Fred Barry, currently giving evidence to the Oireachtas health committee, also said that there was an ""underestimation"" of the project's cost at an early stage, which led to a cost overrun of €1.73 billion compared to the initial estimate of €800 million in 2014."
"Bob Cannard turns over compost that was originally made from San Francisco's food waste at Green String Farms near Petaluma, California, on Friday, March 6, 2009. As a parent and someone who has worked with parents for many years, I was struck by the front-page article about the heartbreaking case of an infant's death in El Cerrito (""Toddler's death in car a tragic lesson for all parents,"" June 10). The assumption that parents can ""easily forget that their children are in the back seat"" is, unfortunately, all too true."
"Summary: Southeast Toyota Distributors (SET) is recalling certain model year 2016 Toyota Yaris, RAV4, Land Cruiser, and 4Runner, and Scion FR-S, iM, and TC vehicles manufactured from January 28, 2016, to March 14, 2016. In these vehicles, the certification label may not show the correct added weight of the installed accessories, resulting in the vehicles not meeting the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard number 110, ""Tire Selection and Rims for Motor Vehicles"". Consequence: An incorrect label may lead to vehicle overloading, increasing the risk of a crash."
"An American Civil Liberties Union lawyer asked a federal appeals court in San Francisco to block a California law that requires police to take a DNA sample from anyone arrested on suspicion of a serious crime. The law is part of a 2004 voter initiative that gradually expanded the categories of people in the criminal justice system who must provide a DNA sample through a cheek swab. Four plaintiffs are challenging the provision, which took effect in 2009 and requires DNA collection from everyone arrested on suspicion of a serious crime, regardless of whether they are charged or convicted of a misdemeanor."
"Really? Was it that complicated? The Green Bay Press-Gazette reports that authorities claim they are two to three weeks away from completing their investigation into the alleged sexual assault involving Packers cornerback Brandon Underwood. Underwood is accused by two Milwaukee women of attacking them in the Lake Delton area of Wisconsin, a recreational zone, after a charity event. The alleged incident occurred on June 5, and within days of the incident, police stated that they doubted charges would be filed in the case. One of the main issues was that the women's stories, it's claimed, changed: initially they accused several Packers players, then only Underwood."
"A new logo that will help define how the community perceives the Seminole County school system is soon to be developed, using at least one of the four top winning designs from the county's logo contest. School board members stated that they wanted a new logo because the system's current logo, a ""Stop, School"" road sign, does not reflect the county's academic achievements. The contest was divided into four age groups: 10 years old and under as the elementary group, 11-14 years old as the junior group, 15-18 years old as the senior group, and 19 years old and over as the adult group."
"LOS ANGELES (AP) - Kings forward Anze Kopitar will undergo surgery on Wednesday to repair a torn ligament in his severely sprained right ankle. An MRI on Monday confirmed that the Kings' top scorer will require corrective surgery that will keep him out of the lineup for an indefinite period. Kopitar injured the ankle when he fell awkwardly during the Kings' win over Colorado on Saturday. Coach Terry Murray initially said the Slovenian All-Star had broken his ankle and would miss at least six weeks, but the Kings ultimately determined the injury was a severe ankle sprain. Kopitar leads the Kings with 25 goals and 43 assists."
"Two people were injured in a crash on State Highway 2 near Waikaramarama. What was initially reported as a three-vehicle collision yesterday, police now believe was two separate crashes that occurred almost in the same spot near Apatu Station Road. A St John ambulance service spokesperson said two people were taken from the scene to Tauranga Hospital, one in a serious condition and the other in a moderate condition. Police first arrived in the area at about 1:10pm. ""Two crashes occurred in a short period of time in the same area. It appears an SUV left the road and then there was a collision between a car and a truck."
"Richard Randolph Lamb, a resident of Dunsmuir, passed away on September 17, 2009, at Mercy Medical Center in Mount Shasta. Richard was born in Fairview, Montana. He moved to Siskiyou County from Oregon in 1919. Richard was a U.S. Navy veteran, serving in the Pacific Fleet during World War II. He worked as a locomotive engineer for the Siskiyou-Pacific Railroad for 34 years. Richard was a member of the Dunsmuir Veterans of Foreign Wars. His interests included bowling, cars, music, travel, and a love for his family."
"The Association of Korean Shipbuilders and the Shipyard Association released data confirming the expectations of many analysts: the number of active shipyards worldwide has decreased by more than 40 percent compared to what it was seven years ago. In the study, an active shipyard was understood to be one that has at least one shipbuilding order. The number of active shipyards in China decreased from 380 to 140, and in Japan - from 70 to 60 over the same period, the association reported. Additionally, the world's largest shipyards - DSME, Hyundai Heavy, and Samsung Heavy - may face empty yards and unused capacity as early as next year."
"""Interaction of Color"", a 1963 book by Josef Albers, a German artist and educator who taught at the Bauhaus, Black Mountain College, and Yale University throughout his legendary career, is not intended exclusively for beginning artists. Its fascinating illustrations are a revelation for anyone interested in color theory and human perception. On Thursday, in honor of the book's 50th anniversary, Yale University Press, the publisher of the original edition, will offer a new way to interact with Albers' lessons, releasing the ""Interaction of Color"" app for the iPad."
"MELBOURNE, Australia - Defending champion Victoria Azarenka struggled to repel a wounded American Jamie Hampton, winning 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 on Saturday to reach the fourth round of the Australian Open. Hampton, who required a medical timeout for a lower back problem before winning the second set, and who often grimaced in pain, was on the verge of tears throughout the third set, yet still managed to make 41 winners to keep the world's top-ranked player Azarenka under pressure. Azarenka occasionally appeared frustrated, but overcame an early break and saved three break points in the seventh game of the deciding set before winning the match in 2 hours and 9 minutes."
"Suzuki revealed that 6,401 units out of 12,819 since 2012 had undergone improper testing. Dealing a significant blow to the Japanese automaker, Suzuki Motor Corporation announced that it had used improper fuel efficiency and emissions testing for its vehicles in Japan. According to Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport, Suzuki, along with Mazda and Toyota, admitted to cheating on emissions tests and submitting reports on sample vehicles that were hand-picked during the quality assurance process. Additionally, the samples underwent testing under improper driving conditions. However, the company is currently not considering a product recall."
"Brands should resist the temptation to address a hot-button issue in the Super Bowl as a way to stand out, said Aimee Drolet, a professor of marketing and behavioral decisions at the University of California, at the Anderson School of Management in Los Angeles. ""It's usually not the best platform for it, because the audience is so broad, so you're inevitably going to alienate half the people,"" she said. In other news, officials from the University of California announced that the 10-campus system set a new fundraising record in 2017-18, collecting more than $2.7 billion."
"Margaret O'Brien, 69, moved from Canada to Wolverhampton in 1971, got married, had three children and spent more than 25 years working for the local council as a dinner lady, a Meals on Wheels driver, a lollipop lady and a cleaner. A back injury forced her to leave work a few years ago, resulting in her having to claim benefits for the first time. In 2015, she was told her disability payments were being suspended because she was an illegal immigrant. She was told in a letter of ""our intention to remove you from the UK to your country of nationality, if you do not leave voluntarily""."
"Let's just stop trying to classify them and just be happy, okay? I'll just tell anyone who's interested about Taylor Swift and Calvin Harris dating: they're just dating. You've probably heard Taylor's song from her 1989 album ""I Know Places"". It's a song about developing a relationship while the paparazzi are chasing them. ""Something's gotta give, when everybody finds out / See the vultures circling, dark clouds / Love's a fragile little thing, it could slip away"", she sings. Just hold on, Haylor."
"PARIS (Reuters) - Longchamp, one of France's leading handbag makers, plans to expand its presence in China, its CEO said, in stark contrast to competitors which are scaling back operations despite an economic downturn and a shift in consumer culture in the country. Many top luxury brands, such as Kering's (PRTP.PA) Gucci and LVMH's (LVMH.PA) Louis Vuitton, are slowing store openings in China as part of campaigns to preserve their exclusive image. ""We are still far from being fully developed in China,"" said Jean Cassegrain, CEO of the private group, in an interview with Reuters."
"The Kelly clan's annual gathering is usually a festive affair. Organized by New York Post media columnist Keith J. Kelly, the meeting has been held on St. Patrick's Day for the past three years at Langan's pub on 47th Street. Guests - journalists and others - celebrate their shared Kelly surname and innate Irishness over a plate of corned beef and cabbage and one or two pints of Guinness. But the mood shifted when Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly appeared. Wearing a green tie, he attempted to keep things light: ""The Kellys are fun people,"" he declared."
"NEW YORK — Just minutes before noon on Wednesday, Australian Ambassador and President of the United Nations Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty Peter Woolcott presented the final draft of a global arms control agreement. After the release of the document, Woolcott notified delegates that they have 24 hours to consult with their respective governments, after which they will return tomorrow for a final vote. For many reasons, the U.S. delegation should choose the last option. Below are several sections of the proposed agreement, each of which would require the federal government to unconstitutionally infringe on the right of Americans to keep and bear arms, protected under the Second Amendment."
"The sixth stage of the Charlevoix Yacht Club's summer series took place on August 8 in conditions of light and variable wind. The race was completed by 22 yachts, consisting of a shortened distance of six windward-leeward starts. Affinity became the fastest yacht in the overall standings, and only 26 seconds of corrected time separated the first three yachts of the Spinnaker A fleet this week. Two more races and one additional stage will determine the overall result of the summer series. The race results were provided by Mike Miller and Keith Attee, committee chairs. Jib and Main Fleet: 1 - Sonnet (Leman); 2 - Exitus (Pung)."
"A search for the phrase ""toxic mold"" yields hundreds of scary warnings and ""studies"", but few of them are based on science, and many of them are motivated by profit. Recently, one of my patients was hospitalized with alcoholic liver failure. His history of liver disease was well-documented, but he vehemently denied that anyone had ever warned him about the dangers of alcohol. The initial admission of ""a few drinks"" turned into many more after some effort by the medical staff. Despite his liver being in a state of significant shock, he was stable and lucky enough to retain most of his liver function."
"It's easy to lose democratic mechanisms, but hard to get them back, says the future General Secretary of the Lutheran World. Speaking at St Paul's Cathedral in London, Bishop Katherine Jefferts Schori called on Christians to take action against the world's injustices. The Catholic Church in Scotland has faced questions over plans to charge worshippers to see the Pope during his visit to Glasgow. ""Eleanor's pumpkin has grown so much this week, and she keeps checking on it."""
"(Newser) – After a car fatally struck a 70-year-old pedestrian, the driver's insurance company demanded payment for car repairs – from the deceased woman's daughter. Anna Sedenko, who had recently recovered from cancer, was walking to a bus stop when she was hit by a passing BMW, reports the New York Post. She died two hours later. Police did not issue the driver a ticket, noting that Sedenko was not crossing at a crosswalk or intersection. This contradicts their stance only because they have been criticized.

"The Parliament of Malawi has begun gathering opinions on a bill to limit interest rates, which an opposition member of parliament introduced in the 193-seat parliament to ban commercial banks from charging high interest rates. Alkeni Menyani, chairperson of the joint committee on state corporations, state nominations, and women's caucus, said there is indeed a need for a law to regulate bank interest rates.

"Without fanfare, but happily with a large number of customers, Salisbury quietly reopened its central trading area on Saturday, nearly three months after it became the site of an international incident. The Maltings, which connects the bus station to the city center, had been closed to the public and secured with security measures and tents since former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious on one of its benches after being poisoned. Market traders were relocated outside the trading area by Wiltshire Council during the decontamination operation."
"It may not be a name that's often uttered, like Roku devices, Chromecast, or Fire TV, but the Nvidia Shield TV is a capable media player in its own right, so much so that it even made it onto our list of the best players you can buy. Nevertheless, if you have one, you may start to feel a little envious when you see Amazon Alexa voice assistant support popping up on other devices left and right. Fear not, however, as Nvidia has announced that its Android-based player will be getting Alexa control support."
"Dundee United FC intends to enter negotiations within the next few days in an attempt to prevent Scotland international Steven Thompson from leaving the club next summer without any compensation.

Thompson's contract is due to expire next summer, by which time he will be 24, and he will be able to leave the club without Dundee United receiving any compensation, and he will also be able to start negotiating with potential new clubs as early as January."
"Real estate search says nothing about community competence or exceptional service. Mobile devices are now the preferred method of interacting with the online world, regardless of purpose or content. Video is no longer an option, use it for authentic representation or risk being forgotten. I have a confession to make: I don't attend Inman Connect to network. At least, not in the way most people understand it. As a marketing director for an industry service provider, my primary responsibility is to educate real estate agents. However, when I come to Inman Connect, I get the opportunity to learn from the agents."

"By detaining Haniyeh, Israel sent a signal that the smuggling of Palestinian money is coming to an end. It is an open secret that Hamas has been smuggling millions of dollars into Gaza through the Karni-Abu Salem border crossing since the international community reduced financial aid to the Palestinian Authority after Hamas came to power earlier this year. However, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's decision on Thursday to close the Rafah border crossing to prevent PA Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh from bringing $35 million into Gaza marked the first time Israel actively intervened to stop the flow of money."
"TORONTO — Business owners are demanding significant changes to the King Street pilot project, or they will consider other options, including taking the city to court, says the head of the Ontario Restaurant and Hotel Association. ORHMA president and CEO Tony Elenis said his group will meet with Mayor John Tory this Friday to hear that the city will lift restrictions on private vehicle traffic after 7 p.m. and on weekends.

"""Fox & Friends"" gathered a panel of men to discuss whether women are hiding ""their feminine features"". 

The Fox & Friends morning show on Tuesday gathered a panel of men to determine the ""proper etiquette for wearing leggings"", and they did it in the most refined way - by showcasing young women in leggings in front of them so they could comment on their appearance.

"It was not only that former BP CEO Tony Hayward went yachting on his boat in the midst of the oil spill crisis, but he also does not apologize for it. In his first interview after stepping down as BP CEO, Tony Hayward told the BBC that meeting his son for the first time in three months was just as important. ""I have to say that at the time I was pretty angry,"" he said about the fierce reaction of the White House and the people in the Gulf of Mexico. ""I hadn't seen my son in three months."""
"It can be said with confidence that Cleveland Browns defender and Arizona State University graduate Damarious Randall did not expect such a reaction. After the Warriors made it to the finals of the NBA on Monday evening and secured a rematch with the Cleveland Cavaliers, Randall gave a guarantee on Twitter: ""If the Cleveland Cavaliers win the 2018 NBA Finals, I'll buy jerseys for everyone who retweets this..."" 
Well, by Wednesday afternoon, Randall's tweet had been retweeted over 800,000 times. That's a lot of jerseys - more than Randall could likely afford to give away."
"Elvira Alonso considers waste recycling a key factor for the future. The director of McAllen's public works department oversees the city's recycling program and ensures its smooth operation. Plastic, cardboard, glass, and other common materials are transported, shredded, or relocated for reuse at the North Bentsen site. This operation is a profitable and relieving service for the public good. Clean streets, quality drainage systems, and maintaining the ""Keep McAllen Beautiful"" mission are just some of the services performed in this sector, Alonso said.

The lead seal, dated to around 800 years ago, bears an image of Saint Sabas, one of the most important figures active in Jerusalem during the Byzantine period, about 1500 years ago. Despite the importance of Saint Sabas - whose Syro-Armenian name is Mar Saba - to Christian history in Israel, no seal bearing his image had been found before."
"When I arrived to meet Bono at the bar of his hotel, I noticed Richard Gere sitting at a table with a beautiful woman in a tiny fur coat and a leather hat. Bono, meanwhile, was sequestered in a quiet back room, talking to a portly middle-aged white man in a suit and tie. (Bono was dressed in a t-shirt and a fuzzy sweater that needed its sleeve mended.) It was Randall Tobias, the head of the Bush administration's AIDS program. The administration had just announced that the program was providing antiretroviral drugs to 155,000 Africans with AIDS."

"Dundee has long been a city of rich character, large wealth and extreme poverty. If the new V&A can give it a transformational boost, it will be worth every penny. I declare an interest. I was at the young University of Dundee in its last year as St Andrews College, and, like many whose lives have been tied to the city, I have retained a strong affection for the place and its people. Not everyone loved it. In those days ""cleansing"" sent hordes of the latest intake to what they fondly anticipated would be the secluded life of St Andrews Royal College."
"The Mashiach (also known as the Messiah) is the long-awaited Jewish leader who will bring an era of peace and divine consciousness. The Jewish Messiah is a human being, a descendant of King David, who will lead the Jewish people back to the Land of Israel, where they will serve God in peace, leading the nations of the world to an understanding of the Creator.

The Chiefs have made no announcements about their plans, but it appears there are no plans to let Ford go this offseason.

An Estonian refugee and his alleged accomplice had planned to kill themselves because they were hungry and penniless after being abandoned by the Estonian community, but they decided to kill a woman from North Hollywood first, whom they blamed for their problems, so she wouldn't be able to mock their death.

According to their own reports, they are close to achieving their goal. Can this happen by the end of April? We can't know for sure, as everything is very secretive.

"A new study shows that more Americans will choose the Internet as their sole news source over television, radio, and newspapers combined, and internet reports are considered much more reliable than other media. It also shows that only 1 in 200 people surveyed thinks that newspapers will become the dominant source of information in 2014.

He claimed that sustainability projects had ""stolen"" $300 million from other programs and personally attacked LaHood for his advocacy of cycling."
"How the internet caught up with the world. The early web: unix commands were great if you knew what you were doing. This month the World Wide Web celebrated its 20th anniversary, and the occasion was marked around the globe. It was a welcome change, as a medium that was once hailed as a new frontier of hope, after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, was viewed with suspicion. We had been outraged for years by the possibility that our choice of washing machines and underwear was being influenced by clever internet ads, and in 2018 we learned that even voters' choices were open to manipulation."
"The crowd's reaction to the bombs at the finish line, in my opinion, was exemplary. Of course, many people ran away from the explosions, and that's understandable. But it's wonderful how many people rushed to the site of the explosions, apparently even despite the fact that when two bombs went off, you can expect more. Many of these people were professionals. The finish line of a marathon is a convenient place for an explosion, as that's where the doctors, police, ambulances, and so on are. Some soldiers were on the scene. But others were not professionals."

"VIDEO: On March 30, 2017, drivers in Atlanta on the north side of I-85 found themselves in an extraordinary situation when materials stored under the overpass crossing Piedmont Road and Monroe Drive caught fire, and the overpass collapsed. Despite the 2017 I-85 bridge collapse that threw Atlanta into a two-month transportation nightmare - or the massive sinkholes that have occurred throughout the city - Georgia's infrastructure is actually one of the best in the country, according to 24/7 Wall Street researchers, who created an index using the share of potentially hazardous bridges, roads, or dams to determine in which states the infrastructure is the worst."
"Sanford already has private attorneys. Gerber said he was hired to defend the institution of the governor's office and to help lawmakers understand the gravity of their discussions. ""The eyes of the world are on South Carolina,"" Gerber said Tuesday, adding that lawmakers' decision on whether to impeach Sanford will have implications for future governors of South Carolina and for the state. Gerber said Sanford's disappearance for five days in June for a secret visit to his mistress in Argentina does not meet the high standard required for impeachment. The state constitution says serious crimes or other serious misconduct are the only basis for impeachment."
"The Prime Minister of Israel stated that he will deliver a major policy speech on achieving peace with the Palestinians. The Prime Minister has so far refused to agree to the White House's demands for a complete halt to settlement expansion, without exceptions.

"The most likely source of work was the Boston Red Sox team on Sunday. David Ortiz, who never backed down from a big moment, hit a three-run homer off Joba Chamberlain in the ninth inning, securing the Red Sox's 5-3 win over the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park. The win snapped Boston's five-game losing streak and halted a string of seven straight series that ended 3-0. Ortiz's exploits undoubtedly led the Red Sox to victory. But there was a lot more to Sunday's win, so let's take a look at some notes from the national television event."
"Two mental health advocacy organizations want to know which Vermont doctors received thousands of dollars in gifts from pharmaceutical companies last year, but the companies may be able to withhold some names under a law protecting trade secrets. The organizations claim that this loophole needs to be closed. Last year, doctors and other healthcare providers in Vermont received about $3.1 million in gifts from pharmaceutical companies. Vermont is one of the few states that requires pharmaceutical companies to disclose such marketing expenditures. The payments include consulting fees, travel, gifts, and speaking fees."

"Everyone knows where they were and what they were doing when that nightmare story known as 9/11 occurred. Chuck was getting ready for work, and I was sitting at the computer watching FOX when those horrific images appeared. I had the TV on mute, so I only saw the flames coming out of one of the towers in New York. I turned on the sound, and the words were unintelligible. For some reason, even before I knew why or what, tears welled up in my eyes. It's funny how your instincts take over your mind, even before it realizes what's happening."

"Although giant and spectacular circus shows now travel the world, it's worth remembering how they evolved from what was essentially street theatre. This Colombian acrobatic troupe, comprising a dozen young performers premiering their latest show to the world, is one of the main attractions of the now well-established Showzam festival in Blackpool, held during the February half-term week, featuring acts from around the globe. Circolombia will be heading to London after five days of performances here, but nothing will compare to seeing them in the luxurious surroundings of the big top circus tent, situated at the foot of Blackpool Tower."

Al-Shabaab started posting tweets in English on Wednesday, using the @HSMPress account. (HSM is the English acronym for the more grandiose name of al-Shabaab, Harakat al-Shabaab al-Mujahideen.) Jack Dorsey and company have yet to verify the account, but it sounds pretty authentic: one of the dull tweets said that the terrorists ""welcomed"" the surrender of seven Somali soldiers after they ""apologized for apostasy""."

"When George Orwell wrote ""1984"", he included in it his vision of the future where people would communicate in a language called Newspeak. Orwell described Newspeak as ""the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year"". Orwell's idea behind Newspeak was to create a world where all nuances of meaning would be removed from language, which would reinforce the state's total dominance. Naming something with one word when in fact it is its complete opposite can also be an example of Orwellian Newspeak, such as when a bill filled with spending on liberal social programs is called a plan for economic stimulus."
"A woman was threatened when a stranger approached her on the street in Lindfield yesterday afternoon. Police reported that the woman was walking along Barncroft Drive in Lindfield between 4:45pm and 5:30pm yesterday when she was grabbed by a white-bearded man aged around 40-50 years old.

"It's hard not to be impressed by Lego Cuusoo: the site does a great job of bringing together the Lego fan community to create interesting designs for future sets. Who wouldn't encourage people of all ages to be creative? Lego and the geek community go hand in hand, so when a Ladyada workshop is proposed as a set, it's hard not to get a little excited. Adafruit Industries produces and sells equipment that's easy to use (e.g. special Arduino kits) to inspire people of all ages and skill levels to work with electronics. It's only natural that this makes Ladyada and her company worthy participants who could become a Lego set."

"The second part of Naomi Klein's report on the events that triggered the emergence of a new type of politics in Argentina. Until quite recently, Argentina had a policy of official forgetting of the crimes of the ""Dirty War"".

But until the Argentinazo, most ordinary Argentinians regarded such actions as gloomy rituals of a bygone era."

To break it down, 20 percent of those surveyed want the law to be repealed immediately and the details to be worked out later, while another 28 percent say repeal should wait until a replacement plan is announced, said the Kaiser Foundation."

"Representative Francis D. Gibson discusses the Inland Port Authority bill he sponsored as state lawmakers gathered at the Utah State Capitol building in Salt Lake City for a special session on Wednesday, July 18, 2018.

"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio doesn't plan on visiting Israel until August, but that doesn't mean he can't get a head start on dancing and schmoozing with Hasidic Jews. As seen in the video below, the mayor may not know all the words, but he definitely got into the spirit of ""Heveinu Shalom Aleichem"" and ""Am Yisrael Chai"" at the Celebrate Israel parade in New York City on Sunday. He's far from the first politician to dance with Chabad - check out the video of the Governor of Texas"

"The Gaza Strip is the world's largest prison, where nearly two million Palestinians are locked in by an Israeli military blockade. Last year, racist Israel killed over 2,000 Palestinians in Gaza, including 547 children. The Pentagon rushed in more bombs when the Zionist state ran out of ammunition. Baltimore, like Palestine, is under racist military occupation. The Baltimore Police Department - the sixth largest in the 26th largest US city - treats black people like inmates. According to the 2010 US Census, although 72 percent of Baltimore's population is people of color, 46 percent of its police officers are white."

"Research shows that complex behaviors were transmitted tens of thousands of years ago. Despite intensive scientific research, there are still significant gaps in our understanding of early human life. One of the main questions that still has no answer is: when did humans first become capable of complex cognitive processes? In other words, when did early humans develop complex cognitive abilities, such as prioritization and cultural transmission, that we can recognize today? A new study published in the journal Nature sheds light on this topic; after six years of excavations, archaeologists discovered technologically advanced stone tools created around 71,000 years ago."

The field needs to be replaced, and the bullpens, clubhouses, and press box require repairs. On a rainy day last week, a quarter of the field was mud and tire tracks. It all looked like Vince Lombardi should have been coaching football there - which he was, coaching the Washington Redskins in 1969."
"The millennial generation is not a homogeneous group of people, so a marketing communication approach that suits everyone will not work here. Millennials want healthy food and are willing to pay more for it. Wait, no – millennials are in debt and want healthy food at affordable prices. They are also selfish. But they are creative and tech-savvy, so that's good. And don't even try using traditional advertising with them, stick to social media. If all of this sounds familiar, it's because it's just a small glimpse into the countless contradictory reports about millennials."

"The world that watched had to be shocked by the sight of a burning Britain this week. Looting and arson showed inner London, Birmingham, and Manchester, rarely seen in England, which is usually represented for export through softly focused historical dramas, Hugh Grant movies, or the story of Will and Kate. If this revelation was overwhelming for outsiders, it was no less overwhelming for the British themselves. The mood here is a mix of anger, fear, and confusion. Not that we are unaccustomed to riots: we are. England was burning in another year of a royal wedding, in 1981."

"This is general clerical and secretarial work performed in a school. An employee in this category performs routine and varied office work requiring general office skills. Assignments typically consist of one or more standard office operations such as answering telephone calls and visitors, record-keeping, data entry, including regular maintenance of databases, typing, including word processing of ordinary office/business documents, mail processing, library clerical work, and similar tasks that are quickly learned on the job.

"New research shows that mice with induced symptoms similar to Alzheimer's disease demonstrated improved cognitive function when administered a synthetic hormone similar to estrogen. ""This synthetic hormone improved behavior to roughly the same degree as estrogen,"" said study leader Christian Pike, associate professor of gerontology at the University of Southern California. However, unlike estrogen, which thickens the uterus and is a known risk factor for endometrial and breast cancer, the synthetic hormone, called PPT, caused no visible changes in the reproductive systems of the animals. ""This could be a promising strategy for maximizing the benefits of hormone therapy while minimizing its risks,"" Pike said."

"Forget about announcing the release of your latest album with a giant, expensive street concert - Oasis hired street performers to do all the hard work. On Friday, a group of street musicians and performers were gathered to play Oasis' new songs in various locations throughout Manhattan. The colorful company included violinists, guitarists, and - we can only hope - some of those golden street statues. From subway platforms to park lawns, they played in all five boroughs - even in the pouring rain. Tom and Dominic Di Principe were among those who got soaked in the rain."
"At her weekly therapy sessions, Jullili shared her most unpleasant secrets: depression, debt, childhood sexual abuse. Her psychiatrist at Massachusetts General then typed a summary into Jullili's computerized medical record. After that, more than 200 pages of confidential notes became available to any doctor who treated her within the vast Partners HealthCare system. She only found out about it when one of the doctors later referred to those notes. Jullili, a 43-year-old lawyer, was first worried, then angry. ""The details are something nobody should know,"" she said. But Partners disagrees."
"To attract the private sector into the healthcare system, a significant increase in government investment is indeed required to cover a larger segment of the population. A new health policy has emerged in the country after 14 years. The very presence of such a large gap indicates the priority, or the lack of it, that is accorded to a sector that requires urgent attention and has deep linkages with the country's aspiration to grow faster and become a strong economy in the global order. The new policy proposes seven key changes in the organization of health services, including the desired change from selective primary healthcare to assured comprehensive care with linkages to referral hospitals providing services."
"The CEO of Vodafone Hutchison Australia (VHA), Inaki Berroeta, has attempted to temper expectations around the upcoming arrival of 5G networks in Australia, stating that while his company is moving forward, he does not expect consumer devices to hit the market until the end of 2019. Berroeta refused to discuss any plans for spectrum usage for Australian 5G networks, instead emphasizing the need to create a new ""ecosystem"" for mobile technology before operators begin to promote products. He said he expects the ""majority of the market"" to launch 5G within one or two months of its release."
"SHENANDOAH -- A church in Schuylkill County is preparing to pay tribute to the late Father Walter Ciszek, SJ this Saturday. He was a priest from Shenandoah who is now being considered for canonization. So much has changed at the Father Walter Ciszek Prayer Center in Shenandoah. It's a museum that tells the story of Father Ciszek's life. He was a Jesuit missionary in the Soviet Union, was accused of being a Vatican spy, and was held captive until he was returned to the United States in 1963. He died in 1984 at the age of 80.

"I've just recalled why I abandoned financial journalism after 11 years in the field, including an internship as a correspondent on Wall Street. Although the world of finance had its appealing aspects, I grew increasingly disillusioned with the dominant narrative that always seemed to boil down to money, rather than other factors such as values and social impact, which never seemed to be on the radar. It's not entirely surprising, given the testosterone-fueled trading floors and the fact that there's very little connection between the decisions made by city leaders and their impact on the lives of ordinary people."
"The report, to be released on Tuesday, describes how an unknown cyberhacker breached computer systems in South Carolina and stole millions of tax returns from residents over several years. NBC correspondent Michael Isikoff reports. COLUMBIA, South Carolina -- A single malicious email sent to employees of the South Carolina Department of Revenue in August of last year allowed an international hacker to breach the state's computer systems and gain access to 3.8 million tax returns, including social security numbers and bank account information, what experts believe is the largest cyberattack against a state government, according to a report to be released on Tuesday."
"Syria: Why did Assad go on the offensive? In the presidential election held at the beginning of June, Assad was declared the winner, receiving 88.7% of the vote. This is not surprising, given the nature of the regime. However, despite the fact that these elections were not ""free"" in any way, and that many people were unable to vote because they were in refugee camps outside the country, it turned out that a significant part of the population supports Assad. Why is this so? Stop the criminal attack on Gaza! Yesterday, the Israeli army launched a ground offensive on Gaza."
"Butler made headlines last week after posting a signed letter from Barack Obama on her website. In the letter, Butler was described as ""bright, intelligent and determined"".

"BlackBerry has decided not to renew T-Mobile's license to sell its products. This move, which proved unsuccessful last month, led to a breakdown in the relationship between BlackBerry and T-Mobile after many years of partnership. BlackBerry announced on Wednesday that it would not be renewing T-Mobile's license to sell its products when it expires on April 25. T-Mobile had offended the Canadian phone manufacturer in February when it sent a message to its BlackBerry users, offering them an iPhone 5s for $0 down. The Sydney operator attempted to make amends with a second offer, providing BlackBerry users with $200 in credits towards any new T-Mobile phone when they traded in their devices."
"On November 17, 2015, at 12:55 at night. 
Michael Höppner had to give up the sophistication of Manhattan's streets. We realized that for Manhattan we would have to pay an arm and a leg. We looked everywhere. In the end, we ended up in this neighborhood, and the houses here are just stunning, and everything seemed much better. The people who sold us this house, Rodney and Desmond, live next door. They already had several offers. I think part of what happened was that they wanted us to be their neighbors: a pregnant couple trying to buy their first home. I'm sure that was probably more attractive than 0.1 percent more on the down payment or something like that."
"Mickey Boodaei has been a leading entrepreneur in the security space for many years. He co-founded Imperva, which went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2011, and co-founded Trusteer, which IBM acquired in 2013 for $1 billion. Shortly after that acquisition, he founded Transmit Security. Notably, Boodaei did this without taking venture capital, which suggests that investing his own money (as well as that of co-founder Rakesh Loonkar) in the startup felt similar to when he started his first companies, but in this case, there was no one he had to answer to."

"Can drainage pipes resolve the compaction conflict? How can we increase the amount of water in the Republican River? Perhaps we simply need to upgrade the existing pasture dams by installing drainage pipes. 8-12 inch diameter pipes would allow rainwater to slowly drain out of the pasture dams and flow into the Republican River. Note: This solution does not involve removing any pasture dams, as they provide us with a valuable service, but rather upgrading them. The pipes can be installed at a level that allows for water to be retained for livestock, wildlife, etc."

"WASHINGTON — South Florida has long been a testing ground for some of the most cutthroat politics in the country, with tactics such as creating phantom candidates by rival politicians to siphon votes from their opponents, or so-called ""boleteras"" hired to illegally fill out stacks of ballots for voters forced to vote by mail, mostly the elderly or disabled. But nothing like the 2016 campaign had been seen before, when several Democratic candidates for the House of Representatives became the target of a Russian interference operation that provided Florida journalists and bloggers with thousands of pages of documents stolen by hackers from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in Washington."

"I want to answer viewer questions again this week because we really started a lively and interesting discussion about BIG SAVINGS. Recently on ""GMA Weekend"" and also on ABC News Now I reported that you can save thousands by hiring a medical billing advocate to find and fight errors in hospital bills for you. According to the Alliance of Claims Assistance Professionals, eighty percent of hospital bills contain errors. One of the biggest misconceptions is about errors in medical billing.

"Hull - Where the US goes, the UK often follows, and this is particularly true for negative trends. If there is extreme weather in the US, we usually experience similar phenomena within a few days. If violent crime is on the rise on the other side of the ocean, it also increases in the UK. There are also store riots. The UK has adopted traditional American entertainments, such as Christmas Eve sales, which leave customers with empty wallets and a variety of unnecessary goods. Black Friday has passed, and today is Cyber Monday. Each of these days has become a major shopping day on both sides of the ocean."
"It's been over a decade since Eminem played his sole starring role in the film 8 Mile, and you'd be right to assume that his acting career began and ended there.

Now the project has been picked up by the Weinstein Company, and although Eminem is technically still attached to the project, he may be on the verge of being replaced by one of the biggest stars."

"Up and down the East Coast, voters braved very cold weather in the pre-dawn twilight as they lined up to put an end to one of the most intense and expensive election campaigns of all time.

""The polls are open! Come on in!"""
"As a veteran of the climate movement, I had been conditioned to expect disappointment. So when, as the coordinator of Fossil Free Stanford, I was summoned to the office of Stanford's senior assistant president in early May, I approached the meeting with trepidation. There were good reasons for my concern. Earlier that morning, Harvard University had arrested a student demanding an open dialogue about divesting from fossil fuels. The previous fall, Brown University had unilaterally rejected student demands to cut ties with the thirteen dirtiest coal companies. Efforts to develop climate policy at the national and international levels had not been much more successful."

"The airline operates 744 mainline aircraft, which vary in size and can carry anywhere from 50 to 366 passengers each. For a typical 737 aircraft, which seats 179 passengers, the reduction in fuel consumption would mean a savings of about 11 pounds per flight. According to the article, the discontinuation of the sale of duty-free items onboard, such as ""alcohol, chocolates, and perfumes"", also allowed for the conservation of 1.4 million gallons of fuel per year, which resulted in a $2.3 million savings for United Airlines. It is likely that this also means that United Airlines was making less than $2.3 million from the sale of these items onboard, or calculated that allowing passengers to purchase them on the ground would not have a significant impact on its revenues."
"According to the data presented in the World Economic Forum's ""Global Enabling Trade Report 2012"", the country's macroeconomic fundamentals are strong, making it attractive to at least some foreign investors concerned about the euro crisis. The largest investment opportunities in the country lie in manufacturing, real estate, agriculture, mining, infrastructure, retail, and tourism - these are areas of investment that are largely untapped, considering the volume of foreign direct investment seeking attractive international opportunities. Manufacturing is particularly attractive to Japanese and Korean firms. Retail is thriving due to the growth of domestic consumption."

When we do, we've decided to share it and try to answer that question. Photo: Erby Aucoin, The Times-Picayune archive. What it's not: Nothing even remotely as fun as those smiles might suggest."
"Yields on U.S. government debt rose on Friday after the U.S. government said job creation in March was stronger than expected, but wages grew at a slow pace. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.538%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond climbed to 2.947%. Bond yields move in the opposite direction of prices. Job creation surged in March after a weak February, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by 196,000, according to a Labor Department report released on Friday. The unemployment rate remained at 3.8%, in line with expectations."
"The Duchess of Sussex's wardrobe may be worth a royal fortune, but yours doesn't have to be. The Meghan Markle effect is in full swing - or perhaps full term. Since the Duchess of Sussex - who is due to give birth to her first child within the next month - announced her pregnancy last year, fashion watchers have been keeping a close eye on her every public step, taking a keen interest in what she wears and how she wears it. Such attention is nothing new for Markle, whose style has been iconic since her arrival on the royal scene."
"Trisha Pollard believes that Texas' social services system relies too heavily on the judicial system to combat Medicaid program fraud and not enough on a tool that was handed to it nearly nine years ago: background checks. ""It all seems so simple,"" Pollard said on Tuesday. ""People in other areas of life regularly undergo background checks."" The 52-year-old former lawyer stumbled upon the issue last fall when she served on the Harris County grand jury. During her term, Pollard and other grand jury members handed down indictments against two Medicaid providers, each with a criminal record, including Medicaid fraud."
"Jennifer Garner was spotted taking a stroll with her son Samuel! Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck have yet to release photos of their three-month-old son Samuel, but earlier today Jen took her little treasure on a walk in Pacific Palisades, California... who, of course, was all bundled up! The beaming mom took her baby to a pediatrician appointment and was all smiles as she pushed him in his stroller. She even leaned in to coo over Samuel, who is undoubtedly just as charming as his big sisters Violet and Seraphina."
"In Yemen, Tunisia, Egypt, and Gaza, demonstrations were held against an American film that offends the Prophet Muhammad. The film, posted on Youtube, which is considered blasphemous, triggered violent protests and attacks on US diplomatic missions in several countries. Here, a Palestinian burns an American flag during a demonstration in Gaza City on September 12. Protesters, outraged by the anti-Islamic film, storm the US embassy in the capital of (***) Yemen. A Libyan holds an English-language sign during a demonstration against the attack on the US consulate, in which four Americans, including the ambassador, were killed, in Benghazi, Libya."
"The Mother New York agency suggests giving mothers command rights instead of flowers or cards. The advertising agency Mother New York offers to make a gift to your mom just in time for Mother's Day. Why not give your mom control over some aspect of your life? The ""Momtract"", which they call ""America's premier legally binding gift"", gives your mom power over one issue in your life. The ""Momtract"" is based on the idea that moms actually want control, not candy or flowers."
"Zoho offers a total of 43 different applications in its cloud package Zoho One, but the company has even more projects in development, and it heavily relies on artificial intelligence and a new partnership strategy in individual industries for further growth. PLEASANTON, California - Despite operating in the shadow of larger competitors in the software as a service market, such as Microsoft, Salesforce, and Google, Zoho has managed to secure impressive customer growth for its flagship application package Zoho One. The growth from 25 million users last year to over 35 million in a year is notable, as is the fact that Zoho has signed up more than 250,000 companies or organizations as paying customers."
"The spat between the American intelligence services and the democratically elected President Donald Trump is not only strange, but also for this reason represents an unusual case for evaluating the mandate that should define the relationship between national intelligence and political leadership in a democratic system. Ideally, an intelligence-based national security system performs a sovereign function of detecting and tracking any threat to national security - internal or external - in order to neutralize it in a timely manner. At the same time, however, it does so on the basis of the authority of elected political leadership, which is the supreme guardian of all sovereign powers in a democracy."
"The Australian men's water polo team came close to pulling off a major upset, losing to three-time defending champions Hungary 10-9 in a classification semifinal and will now play for seventh place on Sunday. As they have shown throughout this Olympic campaign, Australia is just a goal or two away from regular wins over the world's top teams. They seriously challenged tournament favourites, the Serbs, in the semifinals before surrendering a three-goal lead late in the game, and today they led with five minutes to go."
"The Sparks added the necessary inside strength to their lineup when they completed a three-team trade with the Charlotte Sting and the Sacramento Monarchs. Center Rhonda Mapp and guard Edna Campbell from Charlotte and forward La'Tasha Byers from Sacramento joined the Sparks, who sent versatile player Allison Feaster and center Clarissa Machanguana to Charlotte and forward La'Keisha Frett to Sacramento. Forward Rhonda Mapp of the Sparks was suspended from the WNBA and must serve a two-year suspension for violating the league's substance abuse policy, according to a two-paragraph statement released by the league in New York on Friday."

"MBOMBELA - National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete on Saturday called on parents in general to be ""accessible"" so that their children could openly express their feelings to them. Mbete was speaking to about 3,000 mourners at the Ka-Nyamazane Stadium in Mbombela, Mpumalanga, during a memorial service for Nkoxezwa Mtembu, the daughter of ANC chief whip Jackson Mtembu. ""Among our children, there is a feeling that we, as parents, want to determine who they should be,"" said Mbete. Nkoxezwa had taken her own life by hanging herself on curtains in her room at the parliamentary village of Pelican Park in Cape Town on March 20."
"It's a long way from Billings, Mont., to Lincoln, Neb. – 850 to 900 miles, depending on which route you take. But that's the journey that a worn and slightly frayed Woody Grant embarks on in the opening scenes of Alexander Payne's new film, the Nebraska native. Payne has been nominated for awards for directing and writing by the organizers of both the Oscars and the Golden Globes, and he has won gold for his screenplays for The Descendants, Sideways, and About Schmidt."
"KENTON, Delaware - a cheese plant in Kenton, shut down by the Food and Drug Administration due to a listeria outbreak, had been inspected 10 times since 2000. A Food and Drug Administration representative stated that during this period, the presence of listeria had never been detected at Roos Food's Inc. facility. The administration had also never received any complaints. The latest disease outbreak affected the health of eight people, seven of them in the state of Maryland and one who died in California. Food and Drug Administration inspectors found numerous violations inside and outside the plant during an inspection that took place from February 18 to March 4, 2014."
"England have called up Fulham goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli, who is yet to make his international debut, for the games against Spain and Switzerland, while midfielder Adam Lallana has left the squad. Bettinelli, 26, was not in Fulham's squad for the first two games of the season but has since regained his place. First-choice goalkeeper Jordan Pickford did not take part in a full England training session on Tuesday. Lallana has returned to Liverpool for a medical assessment on a groin injury. The 30-year-old, who missed the World Cup through injury last season, has left the squad along with Raheem Sterling."
"The extraordinary mummified remains of a 50-year-old woman, found in a fetal position, will be exhibited at a museum in France. According to The Independent, the 1,000-year-old mummy was discovered in 2012 in the ancient Peruvian settlement of Pachacamac near Lima. The French archaeologists who discovered the mummy, curled up in a fetal position, carefully preserved the integrity of the remains, leaving them in the same position they were found. The new exhibit at the Musée des Confluences in Lyon explores various human representations of death across different eras and cultures from around the world."
"Voters on the island of Guernsey will be electing politicians from a single island-wide constituency, rather than the current system of districts. More than half of voters backed the change in the island's first-ever referendum, in which 45% of voters took part. Option A - a single island-wide constituency - won with 6,017 votes, making up 52% of the total. This means that all 38 Guernsey deputies will be elected through a single vote on the same day every four years, starting in June 2020. More Guernsey stories and the latest referendum news. Deputy and Option A supporter Carl Meerveld said he was ""delighted and relieved""."
"We would also like to hide this list if we were Trump. Is Trump his real name? ""I don't think ISIS would appreciate Acro Cats. I don't think. They're cute and they're silly, two things that ISIS hates. In fact, the only thing they have in common is that they're all cats."" One of the costumes reminded Colbert of an acid trip. We'll take one of each. The CEO of Uber made his first appearance on Stephen Colbert's new show ""The Late Show"", but it was far from a smooth ride."

"On Thursday, LightSquared presented its final arguments in support of its proposal to launch a $7 billion LTE network. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has a lot to read over the Independence Day holiday: a thousand-page joint recommendation letter from LightSquared and GPS industry representatives that will determine whether America will get a new wholesale 4G LTE provider as early as next year. On Thursday, LightSquared and the Technical Working Group (TWG), created by the FCC and consisting of representatives from industries that rely on GPS and LightSquared, presented their final arguments for and against LightSquared's $7 billion proposal."
"They may seem a bit scary, but vultures are nature's best cleanup crew. They are amazing creatures with incredible olfactory abilities, the ability to soar for hours without flapping, and a stomach made of steel. Learn about them on September 1 at Hawk Mountain in Kempton as part of Vulture Awareness Day. Attend the Red River Watershed Environmental Center presentation at noon. Kids can participate in the ""Eat Like a Vulture"" activity and observe vultures from observation points. The event runs from 10 am to 3 pm.

"A five-day event to promote cultural tourism through creative media will take place in August in the Gobi Desert, in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The event, called GobiHeaven, combines camping and creative cultural activities and is designed to create a temporary community where interaction and collaboration between people are encouraged. The event program will include music performances, film screenings, and a wide range of art exhibitions, from painting and sculpture to installations and animation, representing an inclusive and interactive fusion of culture, creativity, and entertainment. The event is organized by the China Cultural Media group."
"The central element of the reconstruction is a warehouse built in 1943, according to the date scrawled on the concrete. It is made of wood. The roof leaks. There is no air conditioning, let alone refrigerated storage for fresh fruits and vegetables. The warehouse should have been demolished a long time ago. But those who work at the Powerello house continued to work as always, limiting themselves very little. When it rains, water pours in. Extreme temperatures spoil our food. And this creates serious problems with pest control."
"Delicious, the original king of social bookmarking on the internet, is now in the hands of YouTube's creators, after a popular protest saved it from being shut down by Yahoo. Chad Hurley and Steve Chen, who sold YouTube to Google for $1.65 billion in 2006, will integrate Delicious into their new company AVOS and will begin running Delicious in July.

"Dallas Cowboys scout Gil Brandt, the last remaining member of the original group that built the Cowboys from scratch, was fired by new owner Jerry Jones on Tuesday. ""(Jones) told me it was a financial matter, that he was losing $29,000 a day,"" Brandt said. ""He's probably going to fire four or five scouts, including Bob Griffin. I told him I know I've done all I can. I feel good about the 29 years I spent with the Cowboys. But it's a bad way to end."
"There are plenty of reasons to be skeptical about the ""smart home"" in its current form, but Amazon's virtual assistant Echo shows glimpses of real potential. That's why. I roll my eyes at the concept of a ""smart"" fridge. I don't need my fridge to tweet to tell me I'm out of jam. A ""smart"" toaster? I mock it. And ""smart"" locks on the front door seem like a particularly silly idea - unless you're eager for the company of thieves. I can understand why you might want a ""smart"" thermostat, like Nest, but the hype surrounding it may be exaggerated."
"Shares of Micron Technology (MU) are rising on Tuesday after the company reported fiscal third-quarter results that topped analyst expectations.

"It was a situation that baffled many people around the world, not to mention the passengers on board the British Airways plane. Yesterday, a British Airways plane that was supposed to fly from London to Düsseldorf accidentally landed in Edinburgh after the pilots were given the wrong flight plan. The BA3271 flight was being operated by German company WDL Aviation - which was responsible for the plane and cabin crew - on behalf of BA as part of a leasing agreement. One possibility, it is believed, was that on Sunday the plane had already flown to Edinburgh and back on a previous flight, and so the same flight plan was repeated again on Monday morning."
"Two members of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians pleaded guilty to murder in the early hours of November 2.

Finally warmed up, he boarded the bus on Wednesday evening with a backpack full of supplies and a pocket full of money from the kind residents of Troy."
"The Saturday night game was an exact replica of the Friday night game for the Amarillo Bulls in terms of score and outcome, and if they play another game in the same manner, they will not have any more games. For the second time in as many nights at the Amarillo Civic Center, the Bulls ultimately fell to the Corpus Christi IceRays. This time, the game ended in overtime when Corpus Christi's Kyle Moore scored on the 77th second of the extra period, securing a 6-5 win for the IceRays over the Bulls in the South Division semifinals of the North American Hockey League."

"Maenga is disappointed with your press release against the apologetic statement of UTM president Saulos Chilima. If you think that Malawi is still living in the past when your police lie to the country that Robert Chasowa committed suicide when in fact your party killed him, then you are deeply mistaken. Today's Malawi is not ready to tolerate nonsense. A few weeks ago, when your party was terrorizing the nation, your president Peter Mutharika could not utter a word. Under pressure, President Mgeme Kalirani was tasked to release a statement which did not meet the expectations of the nation. Up to now, your government has not revealed the identity of the terrorists nor arrested them."
"The taxi-hailing service is returning to Taiwan with an updated business model that claims it will comply with local regulations this time. Uber suspended its operations in Taiwan two months ago, but plans to resume them this Thursday. It seems that Uber is unstoppable, and Taiwan has just learned about it. The global taxi-hailing service will resume operations in the country this Thursday after a two-month hiatus, according to the Central News Agency. Uber halted its operations in Taiwan in February after being fined nearly $36 million under a new law banning illegal taxi operations."

There were no reports of injuries among firefighters."
"With the economy beginning to slow, Ben Bernanke's war on the country's savers continues. Some of these funds are even paying juicy double-digit yields - like the one my Permanent Wealth Investor subscribers earned 20% over two years. Dividend capture funds: these funds buy stocks in companies that are about to pay dividends and then sell the stocks after the dividend is paid. This way, they can switch between companies with different dividend payment dates, achieving high dividend payouts. The problem is that the stock usually trades lower after the dividend is paid, by the amount of the dividend."

"This opens the way for credit agencies to charge higher fees for delinquent loans. According to an analysis published on Tuesday by the Consumer Federation of America (CFA), millions of Americans are behind on their student loan payments. Data obtained from the US Department of Education show that 42.4 million people in the US had $1.3 trillion in federal student debt at the end of 2016. Since 2013, the average debt per borrower has increased by 17 percent.

"DENVER (AP) — The nonpartisan administrator of the Colorado state Senate has warned staff, aides, and interns that policy prohibits them from communicating with journalists about work-related matters — including sexual harassment. KUNC-FM radio reported Tuesday that Senate Secretary Effie Amin sent two emails reminding workers that giving interviews to journalists is a violation of the chamber's policy. Amin sent the emails in February and March, when Republican leadership in the Senate was insisting that complaints of misconduct and harassment by lawmakers on the job should either be handled confidentially — in accordance with the legislative body's workplace harassment policy — or reported to law enforcement."
"It was a Saturday morning, August. I remember it very vividly. I was on the internet, sitting in bed, browsing through sites, not looking for anything in particular. One article caught my attention: it was an article about the refugee crisis. Men, women, and children were risking their lives to get to Western Europe, and many were dying in the process. It was a story of resilience and horrific trauma. In response, I expected compassion, an outburst of solidarity. But my heart sank as I read the comments. There was so much cruelty."
"A Central American referee, Carlos Batres, fell for the worst simulation in World Cup history, performed by the most theatrical Italian since Federico Fellini, thereby depriving the New Zealand ""All Whites"" of a famous victory over the reigning world football champions. These scenes were reminiscent of Australia's defeat by Italy at the 2006 World Cup, when ten Italian players managed to score a penalty in extra time after Fabio Grosso fell, colliding with defender Lucas Neill. Fabio Grosso falls after being struck by defender Lucas Neill at the 2006 World Cup. Don't be fooled - Italy, a four-time world champion, did not deserve their comeback fairly."

On March 2, three French restaurants were elevated to the highest category - three stars. Hélène Darroze's restaurant in Paris and Alain Ducasse's Louis XV restaurant in Monaco regained their third star, which they lost the previous year, resulting in Mr. Ducasse now having a total of six stars; his second three-star restaurant in Paris also bears his name. Pierre Gagnaire, whose restaurant also bears his name, regained his third star, which he lost two years ago when he moved from Saint-Étienne to Paris."
"He looked the part in jeans and rugged muscles. Many fans believe this nickname was an unwanted consequence of his success at the time. On Tuesday, November 14, the real Rambo visited Springsteen backstage after his Broadway performance. Sylvester Stallone posted two posts about this on Instagram. The first is a photo of Springsteen, Stallone, and actor Benicio del Toro, the second is a short video in which Springsteen bows to the audience at the end of the show, and the camera moves to a smiling and applauding Stallone in the hall. ""We went backstage and spent some time with his wonderful family."
"The internet has changed more in the past five years than anyone could have imagined. It is no longer just a browsing medium: it is filled with Web 2.0 applications, real-time tasks, and a whole range of threats designed to exploit this new usage model. As a result, network security has changed incredibly - it is no longer enough to just block, stop, or restrict IP sessions. Autonomous web page filtering can no longer solve the security problem. This webinar will explain how internet traffic has changed and how your IT perceptions may not match what your users are actually doing, leading to the ineffectiveness of your security measures."
"The fourth episode of Aaron Sorkin's series ""The Newsroom"" is called ""I'll Try to Fix You"", which can be considered the title of the entire series. Like Sorkin's ""The West Wing"", the show wants to fix America, this time through the story of Will McAvoy (Jeff Daniels), a successful, cynical, and boring cable news anchor who decides that he, and journalism, and yes, democracy, can do better. What does this mean? Executive producer and Will's ex-girlfriend MacKenzie McHale (Emily Mortimer) explains: ""Restoring the fourth estate""."
"The Israeli ambassador and almost the entire staff were evacuated from the country's embassy in Jordan's capital Amman amid growing concerns over an attack on the diplomatic mission similar to last year's attack in Egypt. Fears of violent anti-Israeli protests similar to those that erupted in Cairo were sparked by calls for a ""million-man march"" on the Israeli embassy in Amman. The action, planned for Thursday, was organized through Facebook. The slogan ""No Zionist embassy on Jordanian soil"" was posted online this week and has already attracted thousands of promises to attend the demonstration."
"The Maine State Lottery has chosen Fuseideas as its advertising agency, an account that was previously handled by NL Partners of Portland, Maine.

The agency will also handle media buying and planning. The new work is expected to begin in the spring. According to Kantar Media, the Maine State Lottery spent $655,000 on measured media in 2013 and $565,000 in 2014.

"My daughter, a resident advisor at her college, recently groaned, mentioning that she would probably have to oversee additional exchange students in the upcoming fall semester. When I asked why that was a bad thing, she said that exchange students tend to think Americans are stupid unless proven otherwise. They think Americans haven't traveled much, or don't speak foreign languages as freely, or aren't as aware of world culture. I said what any good American would say: Why don't they just stay home, then? Oh, she replied, they don't think our college is stupid."
"Several students had what could be politely called a ""disagreement"" at Graham Middle School. Kim Davis, one of the school counselors, remains calm and composed, helping to resolve the issue. This is the kind of situation that counselors face all the time in Alamance County, North Carolina, and across the United States. Davis' determination to do this part of her job well, as well as launch efforts to help students succeed in middle school, has earned her national recognition. She was named a national semi-finalist for the 2013 School Counselor of the Year award from the American School Counselor Association, receiving the award this week."
"I strongly urge the mayor and council to continue preserving the South Central corridor. It is the only solution that will allow the will of the voters to be preserved without jeopardizing Federal Transportation Administration grant funding and increasing the cost of light rail in Phoenix. Our leaders need to stay the course and support this vital project. It is the only reasonable course of action. In Arizona, all necessary medical specialties are already licensed to provide patients with a comprehensive approach to addressing chronic pain. It is time for medical professionals to work together in the best interests of our patients."
"GREENSBORO, USA -- Representatives of the Piedmont Triad International Airport announced on Thursday that Allegiant Air will start a new non-stop, low-cost air service from PTI to the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.

"A local government official is calling for a major overhaul of the state's standardized testing system following a ""litany of errors"" that he believes impacted the administration of the 2016 State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR) tests. Isaac believes that school districts should have the option to choose from national standardized tests, and that the state should fix the STAAR test. When the STAAR was last administered in May, issues arose with test administration, as well as loss or late delivery of test materials, glitches that invalidated test results, and breaches of student confidential information, according to a press release."

The Abortion Supervisory Committee of New Zealand has appealed a High Court judge's decision that there are grounds to believe that many abortions in the country are illegal. A certifying consultant may lawfully authorise an abortion in New Zealand only if they act on the basis of a certificate approved by two consultants appointed by the Abortion Supervisory Committee. The appeal also claims that the court erred in concluding that the committee may have its own opinion on the legality of consultants' decisions to approve or decline an abortion.
"FOXBORO - The Camelot football team extends its unbeaten streak (17-0) in the new year, just one step away from participating in its fourth Super Bowl in the last seven seasons.

"Johnny Depp has broken his silence about his scandalous involvement in the film ""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald"". Depp has been in his own world for some time now, which has led to very public scandals. The actor was accused of domestic violence by his ex-wife Amber Heard, which was very poorly received by Harry Potter fans. The fact that the producers and J.K. Rowling left him in the film left many fans disappointed. When asked about the scandal surrounding his involvement in ""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald"", Johnny Depp did not shy away from answering and responded to it."
"Rich Karlgaard: You need to look at four areas. One of them is financial regulations, which still make it difficult for small businesses to get credit. You have healthcare regulations, which you mentioned, Obamacare adds a burden of costs everywhere, around every corner. You have environmental regulations, and this is a whole area that is killing small businesses, especially where I live, in California. California farmers are going out of business due to the protection of certain insects. Then you have labor regulations. Last year, we saw the National Labor Relations Board declare war on Boeing."
"To provoke ""sabotage"", foreign actors struck key power plants in the country that ""had equipment made in Canada"", Maria Zakharova explained, adding that the perpetrators were well aware of ""all the algorithms and vulnerabilities"" of Venezuela's power grid. Venezuela began to suffer from widespread power outages last week. President Nicolas Maduro called the power outages ""sabotage"" organized by the US. He stated that several ""saboteurs"" had been detained while attempting to interfere with the power system. Earlier, he accused Washington of plotting to overthrow him, as well as other alleged subversive actions."
"Where were you when you received the 40 Under 40 award? It was 2009, and I had already been working at Grubb & Ellis for nine years. In retrospect, I was a young professional still honing my craft in commercial real estate, developing my expertise, and refining the client service process. What was your most significant achievement after receiving the award? Although I appreciate the recognition as one of the top producers in the company or in the local market and achieved a high volume of transactions annually, I am most proud of my successes on behalf of my clients."

The plans include an extension to give the building a new lease of life as a community centre and theatre."
"The Japanese manufacturer Mitsubishi is set to take its first major step into the full-size minivan market this summer with a stylish and original new people carrier called Grandis. Although it is not due to arrive here until July, the British importer has already revealed pricing details at a very early stage. Full specifications and prices have been announced more than three months ahead of the launch in the obvious hope that anyone considering buying a rival minivan such as the Peugeot 807, Chrysler Voyager or Ford Galaxy will wait to see what the Grandis has to offer."

"In last June, the Tacoma Rainiers team brought a deer mascot Rubarb and a local celebrity, the ""Epic Saxophonist Goliath"", to the roof of the Cheney stadium, where the top-level team performs, to carry out a usual trick designed to delight the crowd. On the roof was also the Tacoma News Tribune columnist Matt Driscoll, who had recently explained how roof dancing had brought his employer and the baseball team thousands of dollars in fines from the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries. But somewhere in the pile of public documents that I eventually got, one letter - from one person - helped provide a more complete answer."
"Recently, my elderly mother visited her bank located in the Eastland Shopping Center in West Covina. As she was leaving, a woman with a child approached her and asked for money to feed the child, stating that she had recently arrived from Italy and had no money or means of support. As is often the case with elderly people I know, she didn't hesitate and gave the woman five dollars. With her kind heart, my mother inquired about all the details of this sad story. The woman thanked her and went on to approach other people in the parking lot."

The amount allocated by the state government for the expansion of the hospital is being used for the renovation. Additionally, 18 lakhs rupees have been allocated for further improvement of the hospital."
"Can faith be taxed? This is the question being asked by churchgoers as the tradition of tithing - giving 10% of one's income to the church - is increasingly being called into question. Opponents of tithing argue that it is a misinterpretation of the Bible, a man-made phenomenon rather than a God-given one. They believe they should be free to donate any amount of their choice, and they argue with pastors, write letters, and leave congregations in protest. In response, some pastors have changed their teaching and abandoned what had been a beloved fundraising method for decades."
"The tide is turning at Frankston, and the Dolphins have recorded back-to-back wins for the first time in almost six years, defeating Collingwood by 13 points at Victoria Park on Saturday. Coach Simon Goosey had a five-year plan to turn the boys into finals contenders, and the results are evident. Frankston beat last year's preliminary finalist Port Melbourne last week and contained a fast-finishing Pai on Saturday. The key, according to Goosey, was that the players were drafted into the AFL system. Michael Hibberd, Dylan Van Unen and Mark Baguley are at Essendon, and Marcus Marigliani was on the Bombers' list in 2011."
"The sad demise of Indian cinema veteran Kader Khan has left a void in the Hindi film industry that can never be filled.

"Will Chelsea change their tactics for the match against Arsenal? Judging by body language, you would never have thought that Chelsea are just two points behind the Premier League leaders. After the defeat by Sunderland in the League Cup quarter-final on Wednesday, Jose Mourinho looked exhausted, a strange mix of irritability, fatigue, and determination. ""Maybe we need to retreat a bit in order to become more consistent in our defensive phase,"" he said. ""That's what I don't want to do, to play more on counter-attack, but I'm seriously considering it."""
"TOKYO (AFP) - Nearly half of Tokyo's residents were unable to name a single Paralympian, and international sports officials are worried about the city's readiness to host athletes. With the 2020 Olympics approaching, the Japanese capital has work to do. ""If the Paralympic Games are not successful, then the Tokyo Games will not be successful,"" Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said in a recent interview with AFP. So, to fill the stadiums, Tokyo has begun to upgrade its infrastructure, make its subway system accessible to people with disabilities, and is urging hotels to check their accessibility for wheelchair users."
"Four-term Governor Terry Branstad is set to officially begin his fifth term today. Branstad, a Republican, left office in January 1999 after 16 years of service as governor.

Branstad is to be sworn in at a ceremony around 10:15 a.m. Branstad told a group of reporters and editors last week that his wife, Chris, had urged him not to give a long and boring speech."

"A man has been jailed for keeping dogs for fighting at his home in Ayrshire. Tony Barbara, 50, was found guilty of keeping two pitbulls for use in fights, despite being subject to a 10-year ban on owning the animals.

Officers found two dogs with stab wounds and scars. The animals, named Kira and Jackie, were being kept in cages in the kitchen and bedroom."
"SANTA MARIA, Brazil – Large stage pyrotechnic balls, suitable for a band known for its pyrotechnic stage shows, may have cost more than 230 people their lives in a nightclub in southern Brazil, according to Inspector Marcelo Arigony, who is leading the investigation into the deadly fire that occurred over the weekend. Inspector Marcelo Arigony told journalists at a press conference on Tuesday that the band members had intentionally purchased fireworks designed for outdoor use because they cost only $1.25 each, compared to $35 for an indoor firework. ""The fireworks that were ignited were designed only for outdoor use, and the people who ignited them knew about it,"" Arigony said."
"Indeed, by Sunday the temperature should return to the 50s, and then possibly reach the upper 70s by January 10. But first, the National Weather Service forecasts mostly sunny skies and a high of 59 degrees on Tuesday. The front will move into Fort Worth by mid-day, but its effects will likely only be felt during the nighttime hours, leading to a rather chilly morning wake-up call on Wednesday with temperatures just a bit above freezing. The high on Wednesday should be 46 degrees under partly cloudy skies, followed by a low of 28 degrees."
"Numerous bills in the New Jersey State General Assembly are of interest to truckers and other road users across the state. Repeat offenders who commit a drunk driving offense may soon face harsher penalties for their actions. Currently, New Jersey state law limits the penalty for offenders to a misdemeanor, typically carrying a $2,500 bail. The designation as a misdemeanor allows drivers charged with drunk driving to continue driving until their court date. A bill currently before the Assembly would put an end to this practice. Instead, A3057 would increase the penalty for a person convicted of drunk driving two or more times within 60 days to a fourth-degree crime."
"The Lord of the Rings star Liv Tyler took a stroll with her husband. The Hollywood star couldn't hide her smile as she watched the competitions on the second day of the festival in Cheltenham on March 15. Dressed all in black, the mother of three shone brightly as she watched the races through binoculars. The stunning brunette wore a black silk dress that fell just above the ankles, with a butterfly motif on the sleeves and a belt around the waist. She added a wide-brimmed black hat and clutched a small black clutch with a floral pattern on International Women's Day at the festival."
"Why is a fiery Dutch journalist on the payroll of the former Alaska governor's political action committee? A Mother Jones investigation. In recent months, Sarah Palin's political action committee, SarahPAC, has paid out thousands of dollars to a mysterious company that has gone to great lengths to conceal its ownership. The addresses associated with the company lead to post office boxes. It has no website. It has no phone number. Even the California lawyer who registered the company didn't know who was behind it. But a Mother Jones investigation has found that the company is run by an unlikely foreign political figure."
"The organic lifestyle in Cannon Beach came easily to Lea and Andy Meyer, and their market and café, Sunrise, is just an extension of that lifestyle. ""I love how friendly everyone is here. The culture here is really interesting. And I love the beaches and the sunshine,"" Lea said Thursday, making pancakes from scratch at the café. She and Andy moved from Northern California to Seaside in February. The Meyers fell in love with the Cannon Beach community, opening the café on March 21, and then organizing a summer farmers' market in Cannon Beach."
"The Bible teaches: ""Resist the devil, and he will flee from you"" (James 4:7). It also tells us to turn away from those who are controlled by various lusts (see 1 Timothy 3:5-6). Many great men of God have been overcome by fleshly temptations and potentially destroyed their lives and ministries. One person said: ""It takes a whole lifetime to build integrity, but it can be lost in just one minute."" These are true words! I believe that one of the most important reasons for the downfall of leaders is that most of them never intentionally built psychological and emotional defensive barriers."

Jason Van Dyke, a former Chicago police officer whose fatal shooting of a black teenager, Laquan McDonald, in 2014 revived heated national debates about police shootings, was sentenced on Friday to six years and nine months in prison. The veteran officer was found guilty in October of second-degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery with a firearm for the October 2014 shooting. The shooting and its video sparked protests across Chicago and calls for Van Dyke to receive a significant prison sentence."
"Did Led Zeppelin steal from 1960s band Spirit? And did ""The Voice"" steal from ""American Idol""? A recent lawsuit by the heirs of the composer of ""Taurus"" claims that ""Stairway To Heaven"" infringes on copyright laws. Creative people have been borrowing from each other for centuries. But what constitutes real harm - business, artistic, or otherwise? How much of the original art is carried over into the new work? That's always the murkiest part. Music copyright infringement lawsuits have been going on for over a century."
"A detailed process of updating, I hope it can be useful to you if you don't have such experience before. Let me take care of the back and unscrew the screws. Be careful, the keyboard is connected to the blue connector, carefully pull it out! Take the back again and start unscrewing the screws in a row. Pull out the back bracket. Now start replacing the SSD. Okay. It fits perfectly into the slot. Assemble the screws so that they fit the SSD. Evaluate the SSD rating, surprised me again, 7.8 points. As far as I know, the highest rating is 7.9."
"Being optimistic about the first housing project in Cavite, Century Properties Group Inc. (CPG) and Mitsubishi Corp. signed an agreement on Wednesday to establish a new joint venture that will bring to market affordable homes worth around 57 billion pesos over the next five years.

Each unit will be priced from 1 million to 6 million pesos, targeting first-time middle-class buyers."

After two high-speed games in Kansas, the third game of the World Series turned into a more restrained pitchers' duel when the Royals won in San Francisco. The Royals' first baseman, Eric Hosmer, celebrates after Hunter Pence of the Giants was taken out, which completed the third game of the World Series on Friday. The third game of the World Series turned into a bullpen confrontation on Friday, when eight relievers struck out nine for 7 1/3 scoreless innings for the Giants and the Royals."

"Jeremy Tucker is leaving his high-ranking marketing position at Nissan North America to ""pursue other opportunities,"" according to the automaker. An informed source claims that Tucker, who held the role of vice president of marketing communications and media at Nissan, was let go. However, Tucker describes it as a ""mutually agreed upon departure."" The automaker's sales have been lackluster, and there has been some dealer discontent over the lack of national brand advertising, according to another source. The automaker's total US sales for calendar year 2018 were down 6.2% compared to the previous year."

She previously held the position of executive editor at Columbia University's journal, as well as blog editor at Asymptote and Words Without Borders. Were Edgar Allan Poe alive to read the works of Alejandra Pizarnik, it would have had a terrifying impact on him. Pizarnik is revered by writers such as Octavio Paz, Roberto Bolaño, and César Aira, the latter of whom called her the ""greatest and most extreme"" poet, and she is one of the most important figures in 20th-century Argentine poetry."
"Albion striker Simon Cox has become a target for Championship club Derby County. Rams boss Nigel Clough is keeping a close eye on the 23-year-old and will consider a loan move if he gets any encouragement from The Hawthorns. Sources in the East Midlands have confirmed today that the former Reading and Swindon player is on a list of forwards being tracked by Clough, who wants to strengthen his attacking options. The Pride Park boss is also interested in highly-rated Gary Hooper from Scunthorpe, Billy Sharp from Sheffield United and James Vaughan from Everton, who he signed on loan last season."
"Ken Block creates amazing gymkhana videos. But the police in New South Wales didn't want Ken Block to film this particular gymkhana video - the one you see right there - in Sydney. So the Hoonigan team went to New York instead, leaving Australia in the dust. Here's the video they shot - a video that could have included the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Opera House and all of our city's most famous landmarks. Ken Block's Gymkhana Nine was filmed for the release of Forza Horizon 3, which is set in Australia - so it made sense to film Gymkhana Nine in Australia."
"Rawalpindi: Students of Sadika Public School and Sadikka Learning System (SLS) Montessori and Senior School marked World Autism Awareness Day, according to a press release. The Senior School on Harley Street organised a special assembly to raise awareness among students about autistic disorders, highlighting their causes, symptoms, and coping strategies.

"ANSWER: I will lower property taxes. We pay the highest property taxes in the US. I have already lowered property taxes at the local level. I will repeal the income tax hike. Families are struggling to make ends meet. My opponent just raised their income tax by 32%. I will preserve essential services for those who truly need them. We will end the corrupt one-party system of Madigan. ANSWER: All new and recent hires into 401k plans. Increase the retirement age, except for police and firefighters. Change the annual cost of living adjustment from the current 3% to the Consumer Price Index (CPI)."
"The images we have published from Yemen are as disturbing as any we have used before. That is why we have chosen to publish them. Amal Hussein is a 7-year-old Yemeni girl with a haunting gaze, whose image appears at the beginning of our latest report from Yemen, a country torn apart by war and on the brink of catastrophic famine. Amal is skin and bones, and her head is tilted to one side, as if she cannot bear the gaze of those looking at her. Some readers may also feel the urge to look away."
"Ballinhassig 4-17 Castlelyons 1-12: A polished second-half display enabled Ballinhassig to record a convincing win over Castlelyons in the Cork Premier SHC quarter-final on Saturday evening. Inspired by Danny O'Callaghan and with five members of the Cork Intermediate Hurling Championship-winning team on board, the Carrigdhoun side showed many qualities that could facilitate a swift return to the top tier. Though the forwards will garner most attention, it was O'Callaghan's work rate and the solidity of the Blues' half-back line that sparked their surge in the second half and yielded 2-11 (2-10 from play) on the board."
"US trade policy has become a top concern among finance chiefs, according to a quarterly CNBC survey. Approximately two-thirds of finance chiefs from North America and the Asia-Pacific region believe that US trade policy will have a negative impact on their company over the next six months. Seven of the 16 largest declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average this year have been triggered by trade issues. US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin arrived on Capitol Hill on Thursday to answer questions about trade, tariffs, and NAFTA before the House Financial Services Committee. Mnuchin attempted to alleviate growing uncertainty in Congress as President Trump escalates his trade war with China."
"January 29, 2015: Follow the money. One reason the new peace talks are bearing fruit is that factions responsible for large segments of the population are willing to compromise if it helps stop the accelerating decline in the standard of living across the country. Economic activity is contracting and the deficit is growing due to inter-factional conflict, and especially because two governments are claiming to run the whole country. Then there is all the Islamist terrorist activity. While most Libyans appreciated the help of Islamist terrorist groups in toppling Qaddafi in 2011, since then these groups have become a greater threat than Qaddafi's secret police ever were."
"What exactly sets humans apart from machines? In fact, two things: creativity and empathy. No matter how advanced the field of AI becomes, these two elements can keep the business of agency services thriving and keep marketers employed for years to come. AI is a complement to what you do, it's meant to augment your capabilities. AI can create a layer of efficiency that would otherwise be absent in companies, and free them up to perform tasks with greater impact. Agencies have been successful in the past because they were creative."

"A police officer was fired from the police force for his behavior towards his partner during their relationship. The Northamptonshire police officer, who choked his girlfriend in her bedroom and told her he would ""kill her"", was dismissed from the police force. It took his former partner, also a police officer, a year to report to the police and share her experience of being in a relationship with him in 2018 and early 2019. However, at a police misconduct hearing, the 28-year-old woman told panel members how Mr. Mead would lose his temper and become aggressive during their time together."
"LL Cool J became the first rapper to receive the prestigious Kennedy Center award last week, in a ceremony that also recognized the contributions of Gloria Estefan and Lionel Richie.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington."
"Narendra Modi's selective problem: jobs. Lots of jobs. The Indian government's failure to create millions of new jobs for its young population may be the reason for his election defeat. Aasihk Ahmed Iqbal had no reason to believe he wouldn't be able to find a job. Although he came from a humble family, he studied at one of India's top schools, was admitted to one of the country's top universities, and earned a PhD in history from Oxford University after winning a highly competitive scholarship. When he returned to India in 2017, he was optimistic about finding a job as a scholar."

Consumers are no longer impressed by data centers with an area of several thousand square meters containing 1000 or more racks - this has become a common thing. According to data provided by Datacenter Dynamics, over the past two years, the Russian data center market has surpassed India, China, and Brazil in terms of total investment. Similarly, based on recent construction data for the same period, Russia ranks second after Brazil among the BRICS countries in terms of total area."

The app has already been demonstrated to the Chinese government; the final version may be launched within the next six to nine months, depending on the approval of Chinese officials.

The most obvious and frightening issue is that any malicious version of Dragonfly can be imposed on Google's and Android's domestic users."

"The primary task of North Korea's junior minister for reeducation is to debunk everything French intellectuals have ever said. In one year, he released a special issue on Jean-Paul Sartre and started with Sartre's statement that ""Three o'clock is always too early or too late for what you want to do"". Since it was a sleepy Friday, the junior minister just made a quick call and renamed his local football team to Sports Club 4:25. This made Sartre look very foolish, because the club plays all its matches at 4:25 PM. In fact, every time they play, their fans chant ""Look, Jean-Paul Sartre?"""
