"As part of the LifeMedGreenRoof project, the Standardization Directorate within the Malta Competition and Consumer Affairs Authority (MCCAA) hosted the second workshop to launch a public consultation on the Draft National Green Roof Standard. As part of the EU 2020 Strategy, which aims to reduce energy demands by at least 20% by 2020, the European Commission's 2011 Energy Efficiency Plan identified buildings as having the greatest potential for energy savings. The plan focuses on mechanisms to reduce energy demands of existing buildings (especially public buildings) and the role of projects in promoting the introduction of energy efficiency measures. The European Commission's plan aims to achieve the 2020 Strategy's objectives of reducing energy consumption and promoting sustainable development. The workshop hosted by the MCCAA's Standardization Directorate is part of this goal, aiming to reduce energy demands of buildings and promote sustainable development in Malta through the promotion of green roof technologies."
"Voter scams have been confirmed in multiple states, including Mississippi. Louisiana's top election official is warning residents about a potential scam aimed at getting sensitive information from potential voters, after similar concerns arose in several other states. The scam involves a caller claiming to work for a voter registration assistance organization. The callers offer to register residents over the phone and, in some cases, send absentee ballots to voters, Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin said. Under state law, residents cannot register to vote or request an absentee ballot over the phone."
"For small businesses that operate on a credit basis, accounts receivable can make up a large portion of the balance sheet. During the annual audit, the auditor will verify that your claims about the accounts receivable balance can be substantiated. These claims are called assertions. The most common audit procedure related to accounts receivable is confirmation, in which the auditor will ask your customers to confirm their account balances. Understanding which assertions can be substantiated through confirmation can help you understand why your auditor may require multiple audit procedures for the same account. Accounts receivable confirmation is primarily used to substantiate the existence assertion."
"It's a relief not to have to be Jim Furyk today. 1. The U.S. team entered Sunday with a whopping four-point lead in the Ryder Cup, and the home crowd was expecting to enjoy another day of dominant performances. 2. Luke Donald beat Bubba Watson in the first match of the day, making the score 10-7, but the U.S. still had a huge lead. Whatever. 3. Europe's Paul Lawrie thoroughly defeated Brandt Snedeker to pick up another point for Europe. 4. At least Keegan Bradley, the best U.S. player all weekend, was able to go toe-to-toe with Rory McIlroy."
"This kind of thing often happens: you press the snooze button on your alarm clock once, twice, or even three times, so when you finally finish washing up, get dressed, and are ready to face the new day, you're already lagging behind schedule. Usually, this results in you completely skipping breakfast. It turns out that your breakfast habits are a time-saving method that shouldn't be neglected. Firstly, eating a nutritious, high-protein, balanced breakfast every morning has been proven to be an effective way to activate your brain, improve focus, and performance. Additionally, eating breakfast is also associated with better weight control, as it provides energy for your body and may reduce hunger later in the day."
"Dublin: Lawmakers voted overwhelmingly on Friday to support Ireland's first abortion bill, allowing terminations in exceptional circumstances where the woman's life is deemed to be at risk from pregnancy, marking a significant step for this predominantly Catholic country away from its total ban on abortion. Exhausted lawmakers applauded the 127-31 vote result on Friday, while outside the parliament gates, abortion rights activists cheered as they watched the result on their phones. The vote ended a grueling debate that began on Wednesday morning and ran until 5am on Thursday, resumed after a brief break, and continued until midnight on Friday. Lawmakers finally passed the bill, which will permit abortions in exceptional circumstances."
"The best Halloween costumes are inspired by the most unforgettable moments of the year, and 2016 was certainly a year to remember. We experienced the Summer Olympics and the US Presidential Election, two events that dominate the headlines (and Facebook timelines!) every four years. Add to that Beyoncé's visual album masterpiece, the Pokémon Go phenomenon, and the colorful, quotable chaos of Suicide Squad, and 2016 was basically begging for a Halloween costume extravaganza. We've become experts in all things Halloween - creating over a billion page views worth of Halloween content. This is our moment to shine."

"VOLGOGRAD, Russia (Reuters) - Iceland will try not to be undone by the sweltering heat of Volgograd on Friday when they face Nigeria in only their second World Cup match, after impressively holding two-time champions Argentina to a draw. Making their World Cup debut, Iceland are dreaming of advancing to the knockout stage and writing a new chapter in one of the greatest stories in international football in recent years. Standing in their way, however, is not only a Nigerian team desperate for a win after losing 0-2 to Croatia in their first match, but also the challenge of the southern Russian city's hot weather."
"A pair of thieves in Greater Vancouver have been arrested and charged for allegedly engaging in long-term mail and identity theft. According to a press release issued by the Courtenay RCMP on November 11, the Courtenay RCMP and Canada Post investigators worked together to investigate the thefts, and identified and arrested the main suspects, obtaining a large amount of evidence through search warrants.

"We first looked at which major brands had the most expensive maintenance costs over the first 10 years of a car's life. We grouped all models by brand and all years to calculate the average cost per brand. To estimate the annual maintenance cost, we found the cost of maintenance for every other oil change (because oil changes are typically done every six months). The German imports led the list by a fairly large margin, which isn't too surprising. Toyota and its two brands, Lexus and Scion, were one of the cheapest brands, saving owners at least $10,000 in maintenance costs over 10 years compared to BMW."
"Aurora, Illinois - A suburban teenage boy has died after a tragic accident in a high school parking lot.

"Veteran Congressman Jim Leach (R-IA) lost his election in 2006. I'm not defending ""moderate Republicans"" per se, but it's worth mentioning! Leach, in my view, was absolutely the best Republican in the House. Nevertheless, one can only be glad about his defeat. The fact that it happened only shows how bad the situation in the entire Republican Party has become. Leach was a person with truly good instincts and some basically correct ideas about how America should conduct itself in the world, but he was useless in practice."
"Donald Trump's tweets have long raised questions about whether they violate Twitter's rules against harassment on the service. On Monday, after a Trump tweet that threatened North Korea might ""not be around much longer"", Twitter was forced to explain why the president wasn't banned from the service. Twitter's public policy account posted a six-part tweet, in which the company said it considers ""newsworthiness"" and ""public interest"" when determining if a user has violated its rules. Twitter said these considerations have long been used internally to decide the fate of problematic users. Twitter said its rules are in place to ensure all users can use the service safely, but the company also considers whether certain tweets have news value or are in the public interest. In this case, Twitter determined Trump's tweet, though controversial, was newsworthy and of public interest, and took no action."
"No one can accurately predict when the stock market will end its record bull run, but the best way for investors to prepare for the next economic downturn is to remain calm and stick to a carefully crafted plan. The Star spoke with Ashley Feinstein Gerstley, author of The 30-Day Money Cleanse: take control of your finances, manage your spending, and de-stress your money for good, to ask her why people struggle so much with their finances - and how they can do better. People also often overlook or accidentally misreport other common expenses."

"South Bend, Ind. -- The Irish took to the practice field for the final time on Thursday morning ahead of Saturday's Blue-Gold Game. One of the biggest questions the team faced at the start of spring practice remains unanswered: who will emerge at the linebacker position? Defensive coordinator Clark Lea said that fifth-year linebacker Asmar Bilal is the unit's closest thing to a ""lock"" at the moment, but he seems content with the uncertainty. He believes the position has made huge strides over the past month and a half, but with several months still to go before Week 1, he's in no hurry to have everything settled."
"This month, Drake wrapped up his residency at the O2 Arena in London, but he wasn't ready to fly back home just yet. Instead, over the weekend, he joined host Tiffany Calver on the BBC 1Xtra Rap Show and became a co-host for the day. There, he talked about a lot of things. He talked about the early days of his career and also responded to rumors that he is a culture vulture, because he has borrowed from British and Caribbean culture. But for us Africans, the most interesting thing was that he paid homage to Niniola."

"It's hard to understate the success and growing power of Amazon. Their market value is hovering around $1 trillion. Their growth rate is astonishing. By most estimates, Amazon now accounts for nearly 50% of the e-commerce sales in the US, about 5% of all retail sales, and is larger than their next 10 biggest competitors combined. One study found that about 55% of online product searches start on Amazon. This week, a report that Amazon is considering opening as many as 3,000 cashierless convenience stores, Amazon Go, by 2021, drew a lot of attention, even though they just opened their fourth location a few days ago."
"New York — A lawyer who was caught on video berating workers at a New York City restaurant in Spanish issued an apology on Tuesday. ""To the people I insulted, I apologize,"" he said. ""Seeing myself in the video online was a wake-up call - the way I expressed myself was unacceptable and it's not the real me. I see that my words and actions hurt people and I'm truly sorry. While people should be able to express themselves freely, they should do so in a calm and respectful manner. The video doesn't show the real me. I am not a racist."
"Some applications are designed to change the world, while others are dedicated to bringing beauty to your pocket-sized device. Beautiful Clock Widgets belongs to the latter. This small Android application does exactly what its name suggests, offering a range of clock widgets, with the option to add additional data, such as local weather and battery information. Some are cool, some are fun... and some are downright quirky. It's worth noting that some of the widgets can only be accessed by upgrading to the pro version, which costs $1.26, or the equivalent in local currency."

"[Author: Jonathan Stalin] We often see and hear a lot of unnecessary arguments in the debates between the two major parties, a phenomenon that seems to be more pronounced during election campaigns. However, it is rare for either of the two major parties to actively seek to discuss real trash talk. I mean, real trash talk! Nevertheless, the issue of trash and waste is a problem that affects us all, involving aspects such as public health, social cohesion, and tourism!"
"The town of South Upi is being haunted by a terrorizing incident involving residents of the island town of Patan in Sulu, and it is not coming from extremists, but from politicians. Residents are calling on the government for help to prevent another attack on their island community, which one resident claimed was due to their refusal to support the re-election bid of incumbent Mayor Anton Burahan. ""We are helpless,"" said Bidding Jubair, a 60-year-old resident of Barangay Saidan village, recalling the January 2 attack on the island town allegedly by Burahan's followers, who used an M203 grenade launcher and M-14 and M-16 rifles."

"The life of the mind has puzzled poets and neuroscientists, who attempt to map and label it, and in my case, to find it. In Irish tradition, thinking itself is a matter worthy of thought, and so there are many concepts in the Irish language that involve the mind, dreams, and imagination. As I am only a student, many of the nuances are still unclear to me, but language is about conversation. I would love to hear more mature insights from native speakers on Irish vocabulary related to thought."
"According to analysts, the market has entered a consolidation phase after the recent rally. New Delhi: A below-normal monsoon forecast by private weather agency Skymet had a significant impact on the stock benchmarks on Wednesday, causing them to give up their gains for the day after hitting a new record high. As per Skymet, the monsoon in 2019 is likely to be ""below normal"" at 93% of the long period average (LPA) of 887 mm for the four months of June to September. This led to a sharp correction in the bull run, wiping out the previous gains, with the market finally closing in the negative territory."

Supervisor Sheila Kuehl said the issue should be put to a vote of the county's more than 10 million residents."

Israeli military spokeswoman Michal Ya'akov said that on Monday, a man was seen acting strangely at the Hawara checkpoint, leading soldiers to believe he was carrying explosives."
"Ottawa, March 20 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government faced a new blow on Wednesday as a legislator quit his ruling Liberal Party to sit as an independent in parliament, marking the latest fallout from a political scandal that has dogged the prime minister since February 7. Trudeau has been on the defensive since it was alleged that his staff pressured former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to ensure that construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. avoided a bribery trial.

"The Grant Bar and Grill is a lively spot where local musicians perform on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights, as well as Sunday afternoons, on the outdoor dining patio. If the Old Fish House could talk, imagine the fascinating stories she would share about the 100 years she has spent alongside the Indian River Lagoon. She could tell us about the early days when entire families slept on their fishing boats. We would hear stories about mornings on the river when husbands took the same boats out to join the fishing fleet, while families stayed behind, with wives working hard to process fish at the fish market."

"Maureen Wilkes thinks it's time to understand the true impact of the Vietnam War on veterans' children. Like many other children of veterans, I am a statistic. If this study had been done years ago, maybe it should have been, maybe I would have realized what was happening to me, not to mention my father. Hello, I am the wife of a Vietnam vet, and I have three children. My first daughter was from my first marriage when I was 18, and my next two daughters were from my second marriage in 1970."

"Two years ago, I was sitting in a South Atlantic League baseball game (Low A) watching the Hagerstown Suns host the visiting Greensboro Grasshoppers. Behind me were two Greensboro pitchers, Trevor Richards and Ben Meyer, charting the game. As I discussed in this article, neither of the two pitchers seemed to be on the radar to make it to the big leagues. Richards went undrafted out of a small college in 2015, so he had to start his professional career with the Gateway Grizzlies of the independent Frontier League. He was signed by the Miami Marlins in 2016 after pitching well for Greensboro."
"The United Nations, August 26 -- As media predictions of a US missile strike on Syria grow, people can't help but wonder: will the US still launch a strike while the UN investigation team is still in Syria, regardless of what they find in the suburbs of Damascus? The question is: regarding Syria, British and US officials have stated that the investigation at this time may be futile because Damascus has had time to destroy some evidence. What does the UN hope to achieve through this investigation? What actions is the UN willing to take?"

"Without a doubt, the addiction drama ""Beautiful Boy"" - not the horror film ""Halloween"" - is the most frightening film in theaters this weekend. Starring Steve Carell and Timothée Chalamet, the movie provides a haunting and unsettling portrayal of a young man's descent into methamphetamine addiction (as well as heroin, pills, and marijuana) and the efforts of a devoted father to save him. It's a true and terrifying story, so powerful that even uninspired direction and clichéd writing can't diminish its impact."

"United Nations, 6 July, Update -- With the mandate of the United Nations Mission in Sudan set to expire on 8 July, and South Sudan due to declare independence the following day, a Security Council resolution on the creation of a new mission in South Sudan had yet to be adopted as of 6 July in New York. At a meeting of deputy permanent representatives on 5 July, one member objected to the establishment of a new mission before South Sudan's formal declaration of independence, and received the support of some others, citing a paragraph in a draft resolution welcoming the birth of South Sudan."
"Nothing motivates people to bury the hatchet like ratings and an upcoming contract negotiation. In a meeting held over Midtown Manhattan, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination and the queen of prime-time news put their past differences to rest. Donald Trump and Megyn Kelly, who had been publicly at odds, or privately sulking, or ignoring each other for much of the election cycle, met on Monday at Trump Tower, apparently ending their silence. ""Yes, when I walked in, the doorman looked a little shocked,"" Kelly said on her Fox News show on Wednesday night."

"Magic is the best way to describe the Hurricanes Championship win for the Lytton High School rugby academy. In just two years since the academy was established, the Lytton Under 15 girls' rugby team, guided by Trish Hina, defeated Wanganui 66-0 in Levin, Feilding 42-0, and Kapiti 49-0. On the second day, they defeated the Wairarapa-Bush Combined team 61-0, Mana College 73-5, and then thrashed Feilding 63-10 in the final. The Lytton team was a tight unit, conceding only three tries in six games. Former Black Ferns member Hina said: ""The girls have worked hard to get to where they are today."""

"Preble County - In the past week, there have been two serious traffic accidents in Preble County involving young people, and Preble County Sheriff Mike Simpson discussed summer driving habits as young and inexperienced drivers become more active during the summer months. According to Simpson, the roads often become busier during the summer, and young drivers tend to be on the road more frequently as they are no longer in school. ""Kids are out of school or college students are home on break, so you have more young drivers on the road, going back and forth to events or work, and they're not spending 6-7 hours a day in school,"" Simpson said."
"The relatives of the deceased bravely listened to the details of the cause of death being made public. The heart-wrenching details of the death of the victims of the Crusader helicopter accident were read out today in the investigation into the fatal accident. This was a legal mechanism presented in a joint memorandum of agreement, meaning that the prosecution and the other 14 legal parties in the investigation would not question these details. Gary Arthur, a 48-year-old sales consultant, was found trapped under the rubble of a bar, at which point he had no pulse. The rescue personnel found him with no signs of life. The autopsy results showed that he died from head injuries."
"The state Board of Corrections voted unanimously at a special meeting this morning to appoint interim Director Kevin Murphy as the permanent head of the Department of Community Correction. His current salary of $123,380 will remain unchanged. Murphy was appointed to the position after Governor Asa Hutchinson fired former director Sheila Sharp, who was let go after questioning whether the agency had sufficient staffing for its parole and probation officers. Murphy comes to the job with a complicated history, having simultaneously drawn pay from a nonprofit organization that serves agency employees and a retirement fund from the corrections department."
"As Californians, as people with the most say, should know what it means to push people off their land. In the 1950s and 60s, California funded expeditionary forces every year to drive out all Native Americans from entire regions. But this is not just a historical phenomenon: in the West Bank, Israeli settlers and the Israeli government have been trying for decades to eliminate the small Palestinian village of Susya, which has existed near Hebron since at least the 19th century. In the 1980s, it was declared an archaeological site in order to move the settlers in and replace the previous inhabitants."

An Iranian was arrested on suspicion of human trafficking and forging official documents, according to a report published by Asharq al-Awsat on Friday."
"Every year, the civic body and the state government ensure to remind the citizens of Bengaluru about safety ahead of Deepavali. However, like every year, the city has already reported over 60 firecracker-related injuries this year. What's shocking is that children between 4-14 years have suffered eye injuries due to neglect of fire safety precautions. The city has been in a festive mood since Tuesday, but the city's hospitals have already recorded 60 firecracker-related injuries. However, since yesterday, local clinics in many residential areas have been getting patients by the hour, adding to the number."
"Bhubaneswar: Finance and Taxation Minister Sashi Bhusan Behera hopes that the Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) would participate in the special purpose vehicle created for the Petroleum, Chemicals and Petrochemicals Investment Region (PCPIR) and the Plastic Park at Paradip through equity participation. Besides, IOCL also needs to formulate an attractive raw material pricing mechanism to incentivise the companies to set up their base at Paradip.

"A cancer expert has discovered a way to kill tumors with light in just two hours. The technique involves injecting a chemical and then exposing it to ultraviolet light. Cancer cells in laboratory mice were found to self-destruct, with up to 95% of cancer cells dying within two hours. Professor Matthew Gdovin revealed that cancer cells he injected with the compound nitrobenzaldehyde became too acidic to survive. After applying for a patent for the ""photodynamic"" treatment, he said: ""There are many different types of cancer, but they all share the trait of being susceptible to this induced cell suicide."""
"Drones have appeared in a variety of different shapes and sizes in recent days, but generally speaking, most drones still belong to one of two categories. One type is the multi-rotor type (quadcopters, hexacopters, octocopters, etc.), and the other type is the fixed-wing type. Both types of drones have their own advantages and disadvantages. Multi-rotor aircraft are generally more stable and easier to fly, but much slower than fixed-wing drones that focus on accelerating forward. On the other hand, fixed-wing drones can fly faster and farther than their hovering counterparts, but are more difficult to operate because they cannot take off and land vertically."
"Basel, Switzerland - Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche Holding Ltd. said on Monday that it has received reports of 13 cases of H1N1 flu developing resistance to oseltamivir (Tamiflu), calling it a very low percentage. David Reddy, the head of Roche's pandemic taskforce for oseltamivir, said a good sign was that people infected with the resistant strain had not passed the disease on to others. The resistant variant also tends to produce only mild symptoms, just like the widely circulating strain. The 13 cases were scattered across the globe, including Europe, the United States, and Asia."
"Russian President Vladimir Putin described Turkey's downing of a Russian warplane as a ""stab in the back by terrorist accomplices"" and said the incident would have serious consequences. Before meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi on Tuesday, Putin said the downed plane was attacked in Syrian airspace, just 1 kilometer from the Turkish border, and crashed 4 kilometers inside Syria. This contradicts Turkey's claim that the plane had been warned multiple times before being shot down for straying into Turkish airspace."
"Arsene Wenger believes that the return to fitness of England forward Theo Walcott and the impending recovery of Germany international Lukas Podolski means Arsenal do not have to feel extra pressure to buy another striker in January. The Gunners resume domestic action on Saturday, looking to bounce back from their defeat at Manchester United with a win over third-placed Southampton to remain top of the Barclays Premier League. Walcott is ready to face his former club after two months out following abdominal surgery. Meanwhile, Podolski, who has been out since 27 August with a hamstring injury, is expected to be back in contention by the end of December. The Gunners are hoping the returns of Walcott and Podolski will help them maintain their position at the top of the league."
"The New York Knicks have reached the quarter mark of their schedule with a mediocre 9-9 record, with the goal of ending their 43-year championship drought. Coach Jeff Hornacek and the Knicks will have an advantage in December as they face their opponents. Among the 15 games to be played this month, only five are against teams with a winning record. They will host the 5-13 Minnesota Timberwolves at home on Friday. Joakim Noah, Derrick Rose, and Carmelo Anthony are undoubtedly the biggest stars on the team, but their performance has not yet met expectations. Anthony's team-leading average of 22.2 points is slightly higher than last season. Hornacek and the Knicks hope to achieve more wins in December to lay the foundation for the team's playoff journey."
"The Hashim library was always a beacon of knowledge and a destination for readers and intellectuals until the year 2000 when the number of readers began to decline due to the difficult economic situation in the Gaza Strip. In the 1950s, the Hashim library was commissioned to sell newspapers and books from the renowned Egyptian publisher and distributor. It was also a place where writers and intellectuals would gather. However, the invasion of the internet and the poverty of the residents of the Gaza Strip have stifled these activities. ""Due to the rise of the internet and economic stagnation, we are no longer able to obtain books for distribution or sale."
"Google's relationship with China has long been strained, with the search giant largely pulling out of the country after accusing state-sponsored hackers of attacking the company's systems and employees. That's unlikely to improve with the forthcoming book by Chairman Eric Schmidt, ""The New Digital Age"", which according to a draft reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, ""repeatedly portrays China as a dangerous and threatening superpower in this interconnected world"", Tom Gara writes."
"Ray Trew has resigned as chairman of Notts County Football Club and announced that the English Football League Two club has been sold. Trew became the club's owner and chairman in 2010, but he said he made the decision due to his family having recently suffered ""vile and mindless abuse"". Notts County, who are currently 16th in League Two after being relegated last year, appointed Jamie Fullarton as their new manager in January. Local businessman Alan Hardy is in talks to buy the club, according to BBC Radio Nottingham. ""I am writing to you with mixed emotions to announce that my tenure at the club has come to an end,"" Trew wrote in an open letter to fans."
"Warning: The video above contains graphic content.  WHEC, New York - A new leadership team has promised change, but complaints about care and conditions inside the Shore Winds Nursing and Rehabilitation Center continue.

"To end the war on whistleblowers, reform the Espionage Act. Over the past 100 years, the law has evolved into a tool for government secrecy. The evolution of the Espionage Act has had a profound impact on the freedom of political debate in modern America. Originally, the law was a vague edict that granted President Woodrow Wilson the power to imprison critics and censor the press during World War I. Today, it has transformed into a powerful law that regulates political discourse by controlling secrets rather than speech. Censorship did not stop with the end of the war, it has evolved. Despite its name, the Espionage Act has always been a broad edict."
"Google is trying to save presentation audiences from having to endure lengthy, rambling questions through a new feature in its Slides software.

In addition to submitting questions, audiences can also vote on the questions they'd like to see answered."
"Manfred Weber, 41, is the newly elected president of the European People's Party (EPP), the largest political group in the European Parliament following the 2014 European elections. He hails from the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) in Bavaria, Germany. Weber spoke to EURACTIV Germany's Dario Sarmadi. David Cameron wishes for the UK to leave the EU if Jean-Claude Juncker becomes President of the European Commission. What do you have to say to the British Prime Minister? The UK belongs in the EU - and is stronger in the European community."
"When Conservative Party leader William Hague walked through crowds of faithful at a lunchtime rally on Tuesday, the presenter's introduction of ""the next Prime Minister of Britain"" was greeted with a burst of involuntary laughter, even from many of his supporters. The Conservative-supporting London Times had just come out in favour of Labour for the first time, backing Prime Minister Tony Blair for re-election. The nation's leading bookmaker, Ladbrokes, had stopped taking bets on Thursday's election and had started paying out on a Labour victory."

Among the few digitized traditional media companies, there is digital advertising growth and wise strategy. However, most newspaper companies find that important data is still heading in the wrong direction. 
Author: Ken Doctor @kdoctor 
On April 24, 2014, at 10:30 a.m.
As we approach the mid-2010s, what position does the news industry occupy in the largest advertising market in the United States - digital advertising? And how are all these paywalls performing? Recently, two reports were released in a week, which together help us answer these two questions."
"From the M1917 to the M1A2, American tanks have dominated the battlefield. The US Army and Marine Corps are approaching a centennial milestone - 100 years of tanks in American service. This animated GIF, produced by the staff of partcatalog.com, showcases the evolution of American tanks - from the creaky M1917 light tank to the M1A2 Abrams tank, and demonstrates how the US went from being a novice in the world of tanks to a world leader. For example, the M1917 light tank was simply a replica of the Renault FT-17. Such copycat engineering is unimaginable today. The US Army and Marine Corps have made tremendous progress over the past 100 years, driving the development of tank technology and making the US the world's leading tank manufacturer."
"The most notable name among such groups is the Bajrang Dal, whose activists burnt alive an Australian missionary Graham Staines and his two minor sons in Orissa in 1999. This heart-wrenching incident is often quoted as one of the early examples of 'saffron terror' in India. The ugly face of Hindu terrorism has come into focus once again, with the arrest of three persons in Maharashtra for their alleged involvement in ""terror activities"" in different parts of the state. According to the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), 22 items were recovered from the house of the accused in Pune. The phenomenon of Hindu terrorism has once again come into focus."
"The discovery of a rare example of a North Eastern lattice gate, by Ron Brown and the AAG Archaeology company. Below is a painting of a Tyneside lattice gate. A toilet door salvaged from a historic building in South Tyneside has become one of the North East's most unlikely tourist attractions. During an investigation of a Regency terraced house in South Shields' Sea Road, staff from AAG Archaeology discovered what is thought to be the only toilet door to enter a museum collection. It was eagle-eyed archaeologist Ron Brown who spotted what is believed to be one of the best preserved examples of a classic North Eastern lattice gate, poking out of the rubble of a demolished toilet."
"The best element of M. Night Shyamalan's 2017 horror film Split, and one of the few things it got right, occurs at the very end. The character of David Dunn, played by Bruce Willis in Unbreakable, reappears in a brief and surprising scene, creating a shared universe that Shyamalan was eager to capitalize on. Unfortunately, there's a huge gap between teasing fans with a fleeting cameo and building a story around it. As the third installment in a trilogy, Glass looks like a mishmash of half-baked ideas thrown into an uneven mess."

"Sign the RootsAction petition to mayors and police chiefs across the country to express your support for the right to peaceful protest without hindrance. The Occupy Wall Street protesters scored a major victory on Friday when New York City Mayor Bloomberg and Brookfield Properties, the owner of Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan, backed down from their demand that the protesters temporarily leave the park for cleaning and then comply with new rules that would have prohibited sleeping bags, many pieces of equipment, and even lying down on the site. However, protesters in many other cities have not been so fortunate."
"Progressive Networks' RealAudio and RealVideo streaming products received a major boost today as Microsoft announced plans to take a minority stake in the company and license its key products, RealAudio and RealVideo 4.0.

"Arlington, Texas (AP) - Mike Minor got to complete what he started, an opportunity the Texas Rangers left-hander never had last season when he returned to the rotation. The Angels have lost 14 of their last 16 road games since September, going 12-2 at home during that stretch. ... The Rangers have homered in all 10 of their home games, the longest home-opening homer streak in team history. ... This was the second shutout win for the Rangers this season, both at home, after they had only one at home all of last season."

"Technology executives discussed the impact of automation technology on their organizations. For many organizations and their employees, technological automation is both an opportunity and a threat. On the one hand, the use of robotic process automation and other tools can improve efficiency by automating manual and repetitive tasks. On the other hand, it has the potential to make jobs redundant. Technology executives recently gathered at roundtable meetings in Sydney and Melbourne to discuss the impact of automation technology on their organizations. One key issue raised in the discussion was how to ensure compliance with governance policies and procedures as ""robots"" replace tasks performed by humans across the business."
"Baceapp Corp. and LightSpin Technologies will be moving into Binghamton University's engineering and science building.

"Washington, March 1 - Following a year of record-breaking natural disasters that exceeded $10 billion, representatives of leading insurance companies said today that the costs to taxpayers and businesses from extreme weather, driven by climate change, will continue to soar. The insurance representatives joined Senators Bernie Sanders (I-Vt) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) at a press conference to discuss the growing economic impacts of global warming. Both Vermont and Rhode Island were hit by Hurricane Irene last August, one of 14 natural disasters in the US last year that caused over $10 billion in damages. The insurance representatives and senators said that climate change will lead to increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events in the future, resulting in further economic losses."
"This was another quarter of rapid growth for the optical equipment manufacturer, but the stock fell as investors were unimpressed with the revenue forecast. Infinera (NASDAQ:INFN) released its first-quarter results after the market closed on April 27. Although the results were slightly better than the company's own expectations, traders were selling the stock in Thursday's trading because the company predicted that growth would slow down in the next quarter. As of 3:40 p.m., the stock price had fallen by nearly 24% from the previous day's close. Let's dive into the results and see how the company performed in the three areas I suggested investors focus on."
"Edgar Wright has never made a bad film, he has never even made a mediocre one. As a result, Wright has so far avoided making direct sequels throughout his career, which makes sense. However, this may change with the arrival of Baby Driver. When Shaun of the Dead became a huge success, Wright, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost didn't capitalize on the success by making a zombie sequel, instead, they made a series of thematically connected trilogy with Pegg and Frost - the ""Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy"", which also includes the equally excellent Hot Fuzz and The World's End."
"The Pakistani Taliban Movement (TTP) is apparently unable to fund its operations due to a lack of funding. Islamabad: The Pakistani Taliban Movement (TTP) has been facing a severe financial crisis since its late founder Baitullah Mehsud merged several scattered groups from across the tribal region into the most feared homegrown terrorist network in 2007.

"The US Government Accountability Office reported that the Small Business Administration needs to improve its planning for its new database system. The Small Business Administration had planned to launch the Electronic Loan Information Processing System (ELIPS), which is used to track government-backed small business loans online, but the Government Accountability Office believes that the agency has not shown that the project is a good investment. The Small Business Administration said that it did not have time to complete the analysis required by the Clinger-Cohen Act because Congress required the system to be online by June 30. The US Army Materiel Command has issued guidelines for improving teamwork between agencies and contractors."

In 1980, a group of non-commissioned officers, despite strong resistance from the better-equipped police force, overthrew the democratically elected government, the police force only surrendering after a naval gunfire bombardment. This led to a de facto military dictatorship (although there was a nominal civilian president) being established in the country for the next seven years, led by Sergeant (self-promoted to lieutenant colonel) Dési Bouterse."

"I first heard these verses in a small chapel in Kiev, Ukraine. I remember the day, because it was a Sunday morning, the day the tragic news of Princess Diana's death was reported. I had just left my job on Wall Street and was living with my mother in Kiev, because my father had passed away, and I was there because I wasn't finding my way forward very well. I recall sitting in the back of the room, with its wooden plank walls, feeling a bit self-conscious amidst the fervent gospel enthusiasm of my fellow expatriates. But when I heard these verses, my wandering mind was drawn back in."
"She grew up in a predominantly white, working-class neighborhood. ""We were the only blacks, and I was called names,"" she recalled. ""I'd pray in bed, asking to be taught how to teach children to be good to me and to others."" ""It made me want to have 'rainbow friends' - Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Rastafarians, and Christians. I always wanted to connect with people's hearts and souls, regardless of their faith or culture."""
"Getty Images photographer John Moore will receive the inaugural Impact Award at the Lucie Awards ceremony at Carnegie Hall in New York City on Sunday. The award is given to recognize outstanding achievements in photography. Moore will be honored alongside eight other winners at the ceremony.

He won the Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Photography in 2005, two awards from the Overseas Press Club, and the Photographer of the Year award at the Pictures of the Year International, among many other honors."
"Guess what, the NBA is actually an entertainment show. Only super producer David Stern isn't pulling all the strings from behind the scenes (otherwise New York would somehow magically win the draft lottery). Instead, the league stumbles along like an over-budget, out-of-control Hollywood blockbuster - driven by the egos of big-money players, full of jaw-dropping plot twists, and subjected to endless rewrites. And it gets worse: we haven't even mentioned the Los Angeles Lakers yet. Unfortunately, the biggest story of the season so far has nothing to do with basketball."

If you're looking for a stylish and relatively affordable luxury crossover that's an alternative to the usual imports, the 2015 Lincoln MKC is an attractive choice. While Ford has been setting sales records and earning profits, its luxury Lincoln division has been left in the dust by competitors."
"The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is going to put a small robot into a volcano in Hawaii to map its interior with data and geographical features such as fissures and volcanic vents. Currently, a similar robot is already exploring the volcano. Dr. Carolyn Parcheta, a postdoctoral researcher at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said: ""We don't fully understand how volcanoes erupt, we have some models, but they are all very, very simplified. This project is intended to help make these models more realistic."" According to NASA, the robot developed by NASA can climb into areas that humans cannot enter."
"Hearst Magazines will be busy in 2018, completing its acquisition of Rodale, buying some magazines in the Netherlands, and increasing the frequency of two of its newest titles. Pioneer Woman magazine, a joint venture with blogger and Food Network star Ree Drummond, published two bestselling issues in 2017 and will increase its frequency to four issues in 2018. In his annual review letter to staff, Hearst Magazines president David Carey said this was a good change for Airbnb, which had tried to launch its own magazine, called Pineapple, in 2014, but only published one issue."

"The daughter of the Kannada tabloid editor today claimed that her father is ""innocent"" and will come out of the case ""safely"". Her father was arrested for allegedly hiring a contract killer to bump off his colleague journalist. Ravi Belagere, the publisher of 'Hi Bangalore', was arrested from his home yesterday for allegedly hiring a 'supari' killer from Vijayapura in north Karnataka to kill Sunil Heggaravalli. ""No one has filed a first information report in this case based on someone's complaint. This is a case that the police have initiated on their own based on the statement of the contract killer."
"Manatees are large, grey, aquatic mammals. They have chubby bodies - I'm sure clothing companies would try to say manatees are ""voluptuous"" in an attempt to convince them to buy plus-sized jeans - that taper off into a flat, paddle-like tail. Adult manatees typically range from about 10 feet in length and weigh between 800 to 1,200 pounds. Manatees are one of the ugliest sea creatures God created, and there are a lot of weird sea creatures out there. These are facts I learned from the ""Save the Manatee Club"" website - curiously, the observation of ugliness is subjective, but it's obvious enough to be considered a fact."

"French woman Isabelle Dinoire, who underwent the world's first face transplant, showed her new look to the public on Monday, saying in a slurred voice that she now looks ""like anybody else"" and hopes to resume a normal life. Isabelle's pronunciation was difficult to understand, but she explained how she was mauled by a dog last year and thanked the donor's family for giving her new lips, chin, and nose. In the 15-hour operation on November 27 in Amiens, facial tissue was grafted onto her face, and a thin circular scar is still visible."
"Did Donald Trump release Donald Trump's tax returns? For a moment, it seemed like Rachel Maddow had a genuine exclusive. Then, suddenly, it didn't... Thanks to MSNBC, the claim that Trump ""paid no taxes for 18 years"" has been proven false. Additionally, Trump's tax rate in 2005 appears to be higher than that of most politicians, and his income was quite substantial. However, we can't be certain if the report was selectively extracted."
"Pleasant Mount, St. Pete County - School officials are requiring students who haven't received the latest vaccines to stay home for several weeks as St. Pete County responds to a mumps outbreak. According to Dr. Sam Ray, superintendent of the North St. Pete School District, there are two confirmed cases of mumps in St. Pete County, one of which is a student in the school district, he said. Another potential case of mumps is awaiting test results from health officials, Ray said. Ray didn't specify which school the student with mumps attends, but said North St. Pete High School is ""involved"" in the outbreak."
"During times of hardship, creative bakers turned to desperation pies: salt and vinegar pie and green tomato pie are not typically on America's list of favorite desserts. But in Depression-era America, these and other desperation pies that still survive today showcased the ingenuity of home cooks. Some desperation pies, like green tomato pie, still enjoy a cult following today. Imagine yourself as a resourceful farmer during the Great Depression, wanting to make a dessert for your family, but traditional pie ingredients, such as cherries or pecans, were too expensive or unavailable."
"There is a Speed Graphic camera here, which was once the standard equipment in newsrooms across the country. You may have seen them in movies from the 1930s and 1940s, with swarms of photographers, press passes stuck in the hatbands of their fedoras. The Speed Graphic was bulky and heavy, requiring flashbulbs the size of light bulbs to take pictures at night, and it was the first professional camera I used, for my high school yearbook and the newspaper I worked for part-time during high school and college. I have a Speed Graphic in my office, which uses sheet film – you take one picture, then pull out the slide, and put in another."
"Anyone who has ever been frustrated with shooting video in low-light environments will be excited about Canon's strange and amazing new camera. It is a camera that can shoot full HD color video in almost complete darkness. The ""multipurpose"" camera, called the MH20F-SH, has a full-frame sensor with 2.26 megapixels. The reason for the low resolution is that each pixel is extremely large - precisely 19 micrometers. This is 7.5 times larger than the pixels on a flagship DSLR like the Canon 1Dx."
"Is our efficient tax office strangling the country? I've never seen a report of the Reserve Bank urging the Government to cut taxes. But that's what's happening now, and it partly explains why the economy is going downhill. In fact, it can be seen from this rare story in history that the Commissioner of Taxation, Chris Jordan, and his team have been doing an excellent job in cracking down on excessive claims, especially from businesses. Due to the productivity brought by computer technology, the government's tax revenue is soaring."
"Facility managers wear many hats, and it's not uncommon for a facility manager to lead meetings, provide plumbing advice, propose renovation ideas, and ensure floors are properly cleaned all in one day. When considering facility operations, facility managers take into account the safety and health of all building occupants. To be a successful facility manager, one needs a solid background in management, technical skills, building fundamentals, and technical aspects. Facility managers are responsible for overseeing the physical facilities of buildings or a campus of structures."
"A professor of communications at Texas A&M University wanted to understand the impact of changes in the newspaper industry on politics in our country, so she conducted some research and published it in the Journal of Communications. If you notice that political polarization seems to have increased dramatically over the past few years, you are not imagining things. As Johanna Dunaway and her colleagues at Colorado State University and Louisiana State University found, this polarization occurred during a period when the number of local newspapers and journalists decreased steadily across the country."
"Washington -- At the center of a nationwide salmonella outbreak, an Iowa egg producer apologized on Wednesday before a congressional subcommittee and acknowledged that his family-owned operation ""got big before we stopped acting like a small business."" ""I mean, we got big before we started adopting some of the more complex procedures that are necessary to ensure that we're meeting all of the government requirements,"" egg producer Austin J. DeCoster said in testimony before the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee. He is the founder of an egg empire that has been linked to multiple deadly salmonella outbreaks in several states over the past three decades."
"A Conservative candidate who stood in a local election has been disqualified after failing to declare a pending drink-driving case, for which he was later convicted. Ben Wong, 48, who owns the South Dragon House takeaway on Silver Street, was standing as a Conservative in the Victoria ward election on May 2, but was disqualified after being found guilty. The deadline for nominations had already passed on April 3, but he had appeared in court on March 21 at Taunton Magistrates' Court, without the knowledge of the local Somerset Conservatives."
"Battfleck is officially no more! Ben Affleck has officially stepped down from his role as Bruce Wayne in The Batman, and is passing the torch to a new actor, who has yet to be chosen. Warner Bros. had earlier announced the official release date for The Batman, a standalone DC adventure film, which is set to hit theaters on June 25, 2021. Shortly after the news broke, Ben Affleck took to social media to wish director Matt Reeves all the best as he takes the caped crusader into the future. It was later confirmed that the tweet was Ben Affleck's way of bidding farewell to the character."
"When dining out, it's customary to leave a tip, but a particular tip added by a New Jersey restaurant to an order of a milkshake and fries has outraged parents. Melissa Desh said, ""My daughter came to me and told me that every time she and her friends go to the restaurant, they are charged a tip."" ""When I asked her why, she said, 'because they're kids,'"" Desh said. Her daughter, Isabella, and other students from Colfax Middle School often go to the Wayne Hills Diner, located across from Hamburg Turnpike."
"Dallas - Like many Americans, Martin Jacobson was thrilled by the Navy SEALs' killing of Osama bin Laden. But the Dallas resident had a deeper connection to the men who hunted down the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. Decades ago, he was one of them. During World War II, Jacobson was a member of an elite force that was the precursor to the SEALs. The secretive unit is accustomed to keeping a low profile, but it's back in the headlines after the bin Laden raid. ""I'm just proud of the SEALs,"" said Jacobson, 89."
"Northern Ireland is today dubbed the race hate capital of Europe, a report on racist violence in the province has concluded. Human rights campaigner Doreen Lawrence, the mother of murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence, was in Belfast for the launch of the report by the Northern Ireland Council for Ethnic Minorities (NICEM). The report highlights institutionalized racism within the justice system and questions how to tackle it. Racist violence has been on the increase in Northern Ireland in recent years, with not just black and Asian people, but almost anyone considered an outsider, being targeted for attack."
"About 300 villagers from Kampong Cham province who are embroiled in a land dispute with a private company submitted a petition to the embassy in Phnom Penh yesterday and then protested in front of the provincial government building, calling on Prime Minister Hun Sen for help. The villagers told The Post that they want an end to the land disputes caused by the companies' ""land grabs"" and said they would rather die! than return home without a resolution. They said government departments have ignored their pleas for help, while the companies have used the judicial system to arrest villagers who have complained about the land clearance."
"The incline bench press is a strength training exercise that targets the upper chest and the front shoulders. The exercise is performed on an incline bench by lying on the bench and gripping dumbbells or a barbell with an overhand grip, then lifting the weight upwards over the chest by extending and flexing the elbow. Alternatively, an incline chest press machine can be used to replicate the movement, with the machine moving on a fixed plane. The incline bench press is one of several exercises that can help create a symmetrical and strong upper body."
"Klopp revealed his delight at ending Guardiola's 22-game unbeaten run with Manchester City, exclaiming ""What was that?!"" during a live broadcast, while the Liverpool boss also hit back at critics who slammed his defensive vulnerabilities, adding ""Blow my shoes off!"" Klopp was in high spirits after Liverpool's 4-3 victory over title favorites Manchester City. In a thrilling match at Anfield, Liverpool surged ahead 4-1 in the second half, before Manchester City scored two late goals to make the ending tense."
"No one asked me, but... if you pay dues to a neo-Nazi organization, subscribe to racist publications, buy tickets to Holocaust denial conferences, and own Holocaust denial DVDs in your video collection, then you might be a neo-Nazi. You don't become a neo-Nazi overnight. You can change your mind and thoughts, and confess to be lenient. If you want people to believe that you are no longer a neo-Nazi, you will have to do a lot of persuading. It takes a lot of effort to shed the brown shirt."
"The first step for Brent Moloney to apologize for his post-game drinking binge was mid-season when he was quietly reinstated to the club's leadership team. The second step, more public and meaningful than the first, was that he won the Melbourne best and fairest award last night. The 27-year-old Moloney received the Keith 'Bluey' Truscott Trophy at the Crown Palladium, beating key defenders Jared Rivers and James Frawley. Moloney's two midfield teammates, Nathan Jones and Jack Trengove, came in fourth and fifth respectively."
"The Weeknd will be teaming up with Daft Punk at the Grammy Awards. LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Weeknd will be teaming up with Daft Punk at the Grammy Awards. The singer's collaboration with the electronic music duo is one of several pairings announced on Tuesday. Anderson .Paak will join A Tribe Called Quest and Dave Grohl on stage. Maren Morris will perform with Alicia Keys. The Grammys previously announced that Adele, John Legend, Bruno Mars, Metallica, Carrie Underwood and Keith Urban will also perform."
"Dartmouth - On June 14th, Flag Day, students from the James M. Quinn Elementary School in Dartmouth gathered outside to celebrate Flag Day. This is not unusual in itself, but this year's event had a deeper meaning for them. The reason is that Dr. Carol Calafati's cousin, Ted Cote from New Bedford, is serving in Iraq. Earlier this year, around Veterans Day, Dr. Calafati asked her students to send cards to Sergeant Ted Cote in Iraq to boost his morale. The students responded by making cards and sending them to Iraq."
"Will UBS appoint Bob McCann or Sallie Krawcheck to top wealth management role? Bob McCann, the former head of Merrill Lynch's brokerage business, and Sallie Krawcheck, the former head of Citigroup's wealth management business, are both potential candidates for the top role at UBS's wealth management division, according to two industry headhunters cited by Investment News. Earlier, the Financial Times reported that UBS's new CEO, Oswald Gruebel, has decided not to sell the company's wealth management business in the US, despite rumors in recent months that he might sell the unit in response to tax evasion allegations and subsequent scandal."
"If the outcome of the US presidential election were to be decided by social media, Barack Obama would clearly defeat Republican challenger Mitt Romney this year. The Obama campaign has embraced social media, with the president having a large following on Facebook and Twitter, and a private social network tool is being used by the Democratic National Committee to communicate with some campaign staff. There is also evidence that the Obama campaign is using social media analytics to gauge voter sentiment and track the popularity of campaign messages. Despite contacting both campaigns to discuss their social media strategies, neither responded."
"Should we stop to define what impact investing is? Alright, now that they're gone, we can get down to business. For over four years, I've been reporting on impact investing as a regular contributor to Forbes, and I've written hundreds of articles on the subject. Here's the thing: most impact investing is only available to the wealthy. This is a guide to impact investing for everyone else, which is to say the 98% of the population that doesn't qualify to invest alongside the rich."
"Health authorities have issued another measles warning after a person with the infection used public transport and visited two universities and a grocery store. This is the fourth such warning in recent weeks. The latest person to be infected visited a number of public places between Sunday, January 27, and Wednesday, January 30. On January 30, they took the train from Aubin Grove to Perth between 10:25am and 11:15am, and the train from Canning Bridge to Mandurah between 2:20pm and 3:15pm.

"It is expected to be sunny today because a high-pressure system will be established over the weekend. After a cold start, the temperature will rise to the 40s and 50s. It is expected to be cool tonight under mostly clear skies, with lows in the 20s and 30s. Tomorrow, the wind will come from the south, which means we will see some milder temperatures, with highs expected to reach the 50s, and some areas may even reach 60 degrees. However, as the day progresses, more clouds are expected to form. It appears that the clouds will thin out at night, with lows in the 30s to 40s."
"It looks like the scene after an earthquake, with orange boxes scattered all over the floor, shoes stuffed into every gap, and bewildered people standing around in a state of shock. But this is not a natural disaster, it's Black Friday at a Nike factory store in Seattle. The Seattle Premium Outlets in Tulalip, Washington, shared photos and videos of the terrifying shoppers after the holiday weekend, showing people trampling on the orange boxes that were originally used to protect Nike shoes, and carelessly picking up and discarding sports shoes as they wandered around the store."
"The 27th annual Southern Iowa Hot Air Balloon Festival is being held in Creston this weekend. Bill Fastenow, spokesperson for the hot air balloon committee, said wind is the key factor in deciding whether the hot air balloons will fly and in which direction. Fastenow said there will be a hot air balloon pilots' meeting at 4:30 this afternoon, followed by a ""Night Glow"" event at the Creston Airport on the south side of town, which he described as a beautiful sight. Ellen Gerhart, executive director of the Creston Chamber of Commerce, said at least 57 hot air balloon pilots have signed up for the event this weekend."

"The unemployment rate in Stark County fell to 6.8% in August, the lowest since September 2008. Stark County's unemployment rate dropped below 7% for the first time since 2008, and the decline can be attributed to several factors. The most likely reason is the oil and gas extraction from the Utica Shale, which has led to an influx of businesses into the area. Oil exploration companies were the first to arrive, followed by engineering and construction companies that provide various services. Manufacturing also experienced growth due to increased demand for steel and drilling equipment from both local and national sources."
"A horror movie icon will be visiting one of Gaston County's haunted attractions on Wednesday and Thursday. Actor Derek Mears, known for his roles in Friday the 13th (2009), Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, Predators, and Men in Black II, will be meeting with horror fans at The Haunted Mill in Belmont. Kevin Blanchfield, the owner of the mill, says he tries to bring something new and exciting to the attraction every year. He expects the appearance of Jason Vorhees from Friday the 13th to boost weekday attendance, which typically sees around 200 to 300 people on non-Halloween evenings."
"Washington (United Press International) - Gold prices remained stable on Thursday after the Federal Reserve released its latest economic report, which stated that businesses across the United States have become less optimistic over the past few months. Spot gold prices rose 0.2% to $1,294.11 per ounce, while U.S. gold futures were essentially flat at $1,293.75 per ounce. As the challenges facing the economy intensify, it is expected that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates stable at least until June. The dollar temporarily stopped rising after its recent gains, while the pound stabilized after British Prime Minister Theresa May won a vote of confidence in Parliament and urged lawmakers to break the Brexit deal deadlock."
"President Zuma believes that the state capture report by the Public Protector is a political tool used to target certain individuals. In an exclusive interview with ANN7 on Monday night, President Zuma shared his views on the state capture report by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela. The report recommended that President Zuma establish a judicial commission of inquiry into state capture, to be headed by a judge chosen by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng. The report investigated whether President Zuma's friends, the controversial Gupta family, had undue influence over the administration."
"We love it because: Few things are more stylish than a good night's sleep. After all, a well-rested night can make you look radiant in the morning - and feel refreshed. One of the most important factors that affects the quality of sleep is a good mattress. The new mattress comes in a variety of sizes from single to California king size, made of five layers of ""premium"" foam, including one inch of ""flo"" foam, 1.5 inches of latex foam, 1.5 inches of viscoelastic memory foam, and 1.5 inches of high-resilience foam with supportive gel columns."
"Jenna Barker of Seton Catholic won the 1600 meters in 5 minutes, 13.04 seconds, setting a regional record, and she also won the 800 meters. Multiple area athletes qualified for the regional at the IHSAA girls track and field regional held at Connersville High School on Tuesday. Other individual regional champions included Richmond's Riley Austin, who won the 200 meters and long jump, Richmond's Nakala Bennett, who won the 100 meters, Seton Catholic's Hannah Stamm, who won the 3200 meters, and Richmond's Austin, Lindsay Griffin, Peyton VanMiddlesworth, and Riley Wetzel, who won the 400-meter relay."
"When the convention's theme appears to be ""Drill, baby, drill,"" which is an energy policy in the same way that ""Tax, baby, tax"" would be a fiscal policy (i.e., it's not), it's clear that slogans are all the party has left. Even if you think it makes sense to increase oil exploration and supply by drilling offshore, you can't really take these people seriously. Unfortunately, yes, you can. By the way, this was the moment when I completely lost interest in the convention."
"The new chairperson of the National Children's Hospital board has said that allowing the hospital's main builder to exit its role would be ""bad business"". Fred Barry, the chairperson designate, was appearing before the Oireachtas Committee on Health this morning, and also stated that there was ""underestimation"" of the project from an early stage, which led to a significant increase in costs, from an estimated €800m in 2014 to €1.73bn now."
"Bob Cannard at Green String Farms outside Petaluma, California, turning compost with a shovel, which originally came from food scraps in San Francisco, on Friday, March 6, 2009. As a parent and one who has worked with parents over the years, I was shaken by the heartbreaking front-page story about the death of an infant in El Cerrito (""Baby dies in car: A tragic lesson for all parents,"" June 10). The notion that parents can ""easily forget their children in the back seat"" is, unfortunately, heartbreakingly true."
"Summary: Southeast Toyota Distributors, LLC (SET) is recalling certain model year 2016 Toyota Yaris, RAV4, Land Cruiser and 4Runner vehicles, and Scion FR-S, iM, and TC vehicles manufactured from January 28, 2016, to March 14, 2016. The Load Carrying Capacity Modification Label may not reflect the correct added weight of the installed accessories, causing the vehicles to not comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard number 110, ""Tire Selection and Rims."" Consequence: Incorrect labels may cause the vehicle to be overloaded, increasing the risk of a crash."
"A lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union asked a federal appeals court in San Francisco today to block a California law that requires police to collect DNA samples from anyone suspected of a felony. The law was part of a 2004 voter initiative that expanded the collection of DNA in the criminal justice system by using cheek swabs to collect DNA samples. Four plaintiffs are challenging a provision that took effect in 2009 requiring DNA sampling of everyone arrested for a felony, regardless of whether they are charged or convicted of a crime."
"Is that so? Are things really that complicated? The Green Bay Press-Gazette reports that police say they are only two to three weeks away from completing their investigation into an alleged sexual assault involving Packers cornerback Brandon Underwood. Underwood was accused by two Milwaukee women of sexually assaulting them after a charity event at a resort in Lake Delton, Wisconsin. The alleged incident occurred on June 5, and a few days after the incident, police officials said they suspected the incident would not lead to any charges. One of the big issues is that the women's stories have changed, initially involving multiple Packers players, and later only involving Underwood."
"A new logo will be developed to help identify the community's perception of the Seminole County school system, using at least one of the top four winning entries from the county logo contest. School board members said they wanted a new logo because the current one - a school crossing sign - does not reflect the district's academic achievements. The contest was divided into four age groups: the junior division for those 10 and under, the teen division for those 11 to 14, the senior division for those 15 to 18, and the adult division for those 19 and older."
"Los Angeles (AP) - Kings forward Anze Kopitar will undergo surgery on Wednesday to repair the ligaments torn when he severely sprained his right ankle. An MRI performed on Monday confirmed that the Kings' top scorer will require corrective surgery, which will keep him out indefinitely. Kopitar was injured when he fell awkwardly in the Kings' game against Colorado on Saturday. Coach Terry Murray initially said the Slovenian All-Star had broken his ankle and would be out at least six weeks, but the Kings ultimately determined it was a high ankle sprain. Kopitar leads the Kings with 25 goals and 43 assists."
"A car crash occurred on State Highway 2 near Whakamaramara, leaving two people injured. Initially reported as a three-car collision yesterday, police now believe it was two separate crashes at the same location near Apata Station Rd. A St John Ambulance spokeswoman said two people were taken to Tauranga Hospital, one in serious condition and the other in moderate condition. Police were first alerted to the incident at 1:10pm. ""There were two crashes in the same area in a short space of time. It appears a ute went off the road and then a car and a truck collided."""

His interests included bowling, cars, music, travel, and his love for his family."
"Data released by the Korean Ocean and Shipbuilding Association confirmed the expectations of many analysts: the number of active shipyards around the world has decreased by more than 40% compared to seven years ago. The study defined an active yard as a facility with at least one vessel in its order book. The number of active Chinese yards decreased from 380 to 140, and Japanese yards decreased from 70 to 60 during the same period, according to the association. What's worse, the world's largest shipyards - Daewoo Shipbuilding, Hyundai Heavy Industries, and Samsung Heavy Industries - may have idle space and unused capacity sometime next year."
"""Interaction of Color"", a groundbreaking book published by Josef Albers in 1963 - a German-born artist and educator who taught at the Bauhaus, Black Mountain College, and Yale University - is not just for aspiring artists. Its fascinating illustrations are a revelation for anyone interested in color theory and human perception. On Thursday, to commemorate the book's 50th anniversary, the original publisher, Yale University Press, will offer a new way to learn from Albers' teachings by releasing an ""Interaction of Color"" iPad app."
"Melbourne, Australia - Defending champion Victoria Azarenka struggled to a 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 win over injured American Jamie Hampton on Saturday to reach the fourth round of the Australian Open. Hampton required a medical timeout for lower back problems and was often wincing in pain, and on the verge of tears, after holding serve in the second set and throughout the third, but still managed to hit 41 winners to keep top-ranked Azarenka under pressure. Azarenka sometimes looked frustrated, but overcame early mistakes and saved three break points in the seventh game of the deciding set to win in 2 hours and 9 minutes."
"Suzuki Motor Corporation found that 6,401 out of 12,819 vehicles had undergone improper testing since 2012. In a significant blow to the Japanese automaker, Suzuki Motor Corporation announced that the company had used improper fuel economy and emissions testing in Japan. According to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism of Japan, Suzuki, along with Mazda and Toyota, admitted to cheating in emissions tests and submitted reports of selectively sampled manufactured vehicles during the quality assurance process. Additionally, the samples were tested under incorrect driving conditions. However, the company is not currently considering a recall of the products."
"Brands should resist the temptation to tackle sensitive topics in the Super Bowl as a way to get attention, said Aimee Drolet, a marketing and behavioral decision-making professor at the University of California, Los Angeles' Anderson School of Management. ""Generally, it's not the best venue to do those kinds of things because the audience is so broad and you're always going to offend half the people,"" she said. In other news, University of California officials announced that the system's 10 campuses set a new fundraising record in 2017-18, raising more than $2.7 billion."
"Margaret O'Brien, 69, moved to Wolverhampton from Canada in 1971, got married, had three children, and worked for the local council for more than 25 years, doing jobs such as a waitress, a dinner lady, a lollipop lady and a cleaner. A few years ago, she had to leave her job due to a back injury, which led to her claiming benefits for the first time. In 2015, she was told that her disability benefits were being suspended because she was an illegal immigrant. The letter informed her that ""if you do not leave voluntarily, we will remove you to your country of origin""."
"Let's just not try to label them anymore, just be happy, okay. Alright, I'll just say it, everyone's been speculating whether Taylor Swift and Calvin Harris are a couple: they're just dating. You must have heard Taylor's 2014 song ""I Know Places"". The song is about developing a romance while being chased by paparazzi. ""When all the others know it too/ Watching those black clouds gather/ Love is a fragile little flame, it could burn out"", she sings. Just stick with it, Haylor."
"PARIS (Reuters) - Longchamp, France's leading handbag maker, plans to increase its presence in China, in stark contrast to rivals that are retrenching in the face of a slowing economy and changing consumer culture. Many luxury brands, such as Kering's Gucci and LVMH's Louis Vuitton, have stopped opening new stores in China to preserve their exclusive image. ""We are still far from having fully developed the Chinese market,"" said Jean Cassegrain, CEO of the private Longchamp group, in an interview with Reuters."
"The Kelly Gang's annual meeting is usually a joyful affair. The gathering, the brainchild of New York Post media columnist Keith J. Kelly, has been held on St. Patrick's Day at Langan's on 47th Street for the past three years. Guests - media types and others who share the surname Kelly and their innate Irish heritage - celebrate with corned beef and cabbage, and a pint or two of Guinness. But the mood shifted when Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly arrived. He wore a green tie and attempted to keep things light: ""Kellys are fun people,"" he declared."
"New York - Just after noon on Wednesday, Australian Ambassador and President of the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty Conference, Peter Woolcott, released the final version of the global gun control agreement. Following the release of the document, Woolcott notified representatives that they had 24 hours to consult with their respective governments, and then return the next day for a final vote. For many reasons, the U.S. delegation must choose the latter. Here are a few sections of the proposed agreement, each of which requires the federal government to unconstitutionally infringe on the rights of Americans to keep and bear arms, as protected under the Second Amendment."
"The sixth race of the summer series was held on August 8 in a light and variable breeze. Twenty-two boats completed the course, which was shortened to six windward-leeward legs. Affinity was the fastest boat on the day, with the top three boats in Spinnaker A division separated by just 26 seconds on corrected time. With two more races and one discard still to come, the overall summer series result is still to be decided. The results were provided by committee boat chairmen Mike Miller and Keith Atkinson. Foredeck and Maindeck fleets: 1 - Sonnet (Captain Lepman); 2 - Exigence (Captain Peng)."
"Searching for ""toxic mold"" yields hundreds of frightening warnings and ""studies"", but few are based on science - and many are motivated by financial gain. Recently, one of my patients was hospitalized for liver failure due to alcohol poisoning. His history of liver disease was extensive, yet he insisted that no one had ever warned him to avoid alcohol. Initially, he admitted to only having ""a few drinks"", but under further questioning by other medical personnel, his story changed to more. Despite his liver being in severe shock, he remained stable, and fortunately, most of his liver function was still intact."
"It is easy to lose democratic mechanisms, but it is difficult to take them back, said the incoming general secretary of the Lutheran World Federation. Bishop Jefferts Schori, speaking at St Paul's Cathedral in London, urged Christians to take action against injustice in the world. The Catholic Church in Scotland has been questioned for planning to charge the congregation to see the Pope during his visit to Glasgow. ""Eleanor's pumpkin grew very fast this week, she has been checking on it."" The position of general secretary of the Lutheran World Federation will be taken over by a new bishop, who made these remarks at St Paul's Cathedral in London and called on Christians to take action against injustice in the world."

Anna Cedeno, a recent cancer survivor, was walking to a bus stop when she was hit by a passing BMW, the New York Post reports. She died two hours later. Police did not issue a ticket to the driver, citing that Cedeno was not in a crosswalk or at a traffic light when she crossed the street. It wasn't until they were pointed out the error that they changed their stance. Well, you know... corporations are people, my friend."

The Maltings, which connects the bus station to the city centre, had been closed to the public and cordoned off with security tape and tents since former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious on one of its benches. Wiltshire Council had relocated market traders to an area behind the shopping centre during the decontamination process."
"It may not be as household a name as Roku, Chromecast, or Fire TV, but Nvidia's Shield TV is still a powerful streaming player worthy of a spot on our list of the best streaming players. However, if you own a Shield TV, you may have felt a pang of jealousy as you've seen Amazon's Alexa voice assistant support appear on other devices one by one. Fear not, though, as Nvidia has announced that its Android-based streaming box will also be getting Alexa control support."
"Dundee United will start talks in the next few days in a bid to prevent Scottish striker Steven Thompson from leaving the club for nothing in the summer.

Thompson's current deal runs out next summer when he will be 24 and can move for free, with United receiving no compensation. He will be able to talk to potential new clubs from January."
"When looking for properties, nothing is about community expertise or excellent services. Mobile devices are now the preferred way to interact with the online world, whether it's the target or the content. Video is no longer an option, use it to make real demonstrations, or you will be forgotten. I have a confession to make: I don't attend Inman Connect to make connections. At least, not in the sense that most people mean. As a marketing director for an industry supplier, my day-to-day job is to educate real estate agents. But when I come to Inman Connect, I get to learn from the agents instead."

"By detaining Haniyeh, Israel is sending the message that the era of smuggling cash from Palestine is over. Since the international community cut off financial aid to the Palestinian Authority after Hamas came to power earlier this year, Hamas has been smuggling millions of dollars into Gaza through the Rafah crossing, an open secret. However, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert decided on Thursday to close the Rafah crossing to prevent Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh from bringing $35 million into Gaza, the first time Israel has actively intervened to stop the flow of funds."

""I have to say, I was actually quite angry,"" he said, referring to the strong backlash from the White House and the people in the Gulf of Mexico. ""I hadn't seen my son in three months."""
"It's safe to say that Cleveland Browns cornerback and Arizona State University alum Damarious Randall didn't anticipate this kind of response. After the Warriors advanced to the NBA Finals with a rematch against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday night, Randall made a guarantee on Twitter: ""If the Cleveland Cavaliers win the 2018 NBA finals I'll buy everyone who retweet's this a jersey"" As of Wednesday afternoon, Randall's tweet had been retweeted over 800,000 times. That's a lot of jerseys - more than Randall could probably afford to give away."
"Elvira Alonso believes that recycling is crucial for the future. As the director of the Public Works Department for the city of McAllen, Elvira Alonso oversees the city's recycling program and ensures it runs smoothly. Plastics, cardboard, glass, and other common materials are transported, crushed, or transferred to be repurposed at a compound on North Bentsen Road. The operation is both profitable and convenient for public service. Alonso says that clean streets, quality drainage, and the mission of ""Keep McAllen Beautiful"" are all served by the work of her department. Subpar products can harm the community, but her work turns those negative factors into positive impacts."

"The lead seal is the first one found with the image of Saint Sabas, an important figure locally 1,500 years ago. A rare seal from the Crusader period was discovered in the Kiryat Yovel neighborhood of Jerusalem. The lead seal, which dates back around 800 years, bears the image of Saint Sabas, one of the most important figures to have been active in Jerusalem during the Byzantine period 1,500 years ago.

"Dundee has long been a city of contrasts, with great wealth and extreme poverty. If the new V&A museum can bring about a turning point for it, it will be worth every penny. I declare an interest. I attended the University of Dundee, then St Andrews' College, in its final year, and like many people who have been touched by the city, I have a deep affection for the place and its people. Not everyone likes it. At the time, the ""clearing"" scheme sent a large number of last-minute students to the secluded life of St Andrews' Queen's College, which they had previously aspired to."
"Moses Maimonides (also known as Maimonides) stated that the Messiah (also known as Moshiach) is a long-awaited Jewish leader who will bring world peace and awareness of God.

"Two men blamed the victim for their plight, a videotaped recording showed: the crime, in the trial of a defendant in the death case of an activist in the Estonian community, he admitted to the crime. An Estonian refugee and his accomplice, who were planning to commit suicide due to feeling hungry and bankrupt after being abandoned by the Estonian community, decided to kill a woman living in North Hollywood first, because they thought she was the cause of their problems, so she couldn't mock their death. This confession was made in a videotaped recording played for a San Fernando Superior Court jury on Tuesday in the trial of 24-year-old Peter Sakarias for murder.

"A recent survey shows that more Americans would choose the internet as their sole source of news over a combination of television, radio, and newspapers, and the internet's reporting is also considered more reliable than other media. The survey also shows that only one in 200 people think that newspapers will be the primary source of information in 2014.

This month, the World Wide Web is celebrating its 20th birthday, and the whole world is celebrating its birthday. It's a pleasant change, as this medium was once a new frontier of hope, but has been suspected since the Cambridge Analytica scandal. We've spent years being angry about the choices of washing machines and underwear that may be affected by smart network ads, and in 2018, we learned that even voters' choices may be manipulated."
"The explosion happened at the finish line, and the reaction of the crowd, I think, was very commendable. Of course, many people ran away after the explosion, which is understandable. But what's worth noting is that many people ran towards the explosion, despite the fact that there were two bombs that went off, and people might have expected more. Many of them were professionals. The finish line of a marathon is an ideal place for a bombing because there are usually doctors, police, ambulances, and so on. It just so happened that there were also some soldiers on the scene. But there were also some people who were not professionals."

""The eyes of the world are on South Carolina,"" Guber said on Tuesday, adding that lawmakers' decision on whether to impeach Sanford will have an impact on future governors of South Carolina and the state. Guber said Sanford's disappearance for five days in June to secretly visit his lover in Argentina does not meet the high standard required for impeachment. The state constitution stipulates that serious crimes or other serious misconduct are the only grounds for impeachment."

The win snapped a five-game losing streak for Boston and ended the team's record seven consecutive series sweeps. Ortiz's heroics clearly won it for the Red Sox. But Sunday's win was more than that, so let's take a look at some notes from the nationally televised game."

"Everyone remembers where they were and what they were doing when the nightmare of 911 occurred. Chuck was getting ready for work, and I was watching Fox News on the computer when the horrific images appeared on the screen. I had the TV muted, so I only saw flames coming out of a large building in New York. I turned on the sound, and the announcer's words sounded completely unintelligible. It's strange that even before I knew what had happened and why, tears were already welling up in my eyes.

Wait, no - millennials are debt-ridden but still want affordable healthy food. They are also entitled. But they are creative and tech-savvy, so that's a good thing. And don't even try to reach them with traditional advertising, stick to social media instead. If all of this sounds familiar, it's because it's just a small part of the many conflicting reports about millennials."
"A series of powerful shorts where kids explain in their own words what it's like to live with various diseases and allergies. The shorts are relevant to the teaching of PSHE and Modern Studies for KS2, KS3 and KS4 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and for 2nd, 3rd and 4th level in Scotland.

Big man Karlis Silins scored 14 points and had 10 rebounds, completing a double-double in the game."
"To the world watching, the scenes in Britain this week have been undoubtedly shocking. Looting and arson have exposed the inner city landscapes of London, Birmingham and Manchester, an England that is usually presented to the outside world through the soft focus of historical dramas, Hugh Grant movies or stories about Wills and Kate. If this exposure has left outsiders bewildered, it has equally left the British bewildered. The mood in Britain is a mix of anger, fear and confusion. Not that we are unaccustomed to rioting: we are. England also burned that year, the year of the royal wedding, 1981."

"New research shows that mice with induced Alzheimer's-like symptoms had improved cognitive function after receiving synthetic estrogen-like hormones. Dr. Christian Pike, associate professor of gerontology at the University of Southern California and leader of the research team, said: ""The way this synthetic hormone improves behavior is similar to estrogen."" However, unlike estrogen, which can cause the uterus to grow and is a known risk factor for uterine and breast cancers, PPT did not noticeably alter the reproductive tract of the animals. ""This could be a promising strategy for maximizing the benefits of hormone therapy while minimizing its risks,"" Pike said."

"Abandoning the usual massive, budget-blowing outdoor concert to promote their latest album, Oasis has started hiring street performers to do their promotional work for them. Last Friday, a group of street performers were rounded up to play Oasis' new songs at various locations around Manhattan. The ragtag team included violinists, guitarists, and, one can only hope, some gold-painted human statues. They played in all five boroughs, from subway platforms to park plazas, even in the pouring rain. Thoth and Dominic Del Principe were among those who got rained on."
"In her weekly therapy sessions, Julie revealed her most uncomfortable secrets: depression, debt, childhood sexual abuse. Her Massachusetts General Hospital psychiatrist would then enter a summary into Julie's computerized medical records. As a result, more than 200 pages of sensitive notes became available for any doctor who treated her within the vast Partners HealthCare network to see. She only discovered this when a doctor later quoted from the notes. Julie, a 43-year-old lawyer, initially felt uneasy and then became angry. ""These details are none of anyone's business,"" she said. But Partners HealthCare disagreed."
"To get the private sector involved in healthcare, what is truly needed is a significant increase in public sector investment to cover more people. The country has a new healthcare policy after 14 years. Such a long time interval itself indicates the priority, or the lack thereof, given to an industry that is in dire need of attention and is deeply connected to the vision of a nation developing faster and rising as a strong power in the global order. The new policy proposes seven key transformations in the organization of healthcare services, including a welcome shift from selective to comprehensive primary healthcare, and a close link with referral hospitals. Additionally, the new policy also emphasizes the importance of preventive care, public health, and healthcare services, as well as the role of medical information technology and electronic health records in improving healthcare services."
"Vodafone Hutchison Australia (VHA) chief executive Iñaki Berroeta is attempting to temper expectations around Australia's impending 5G network, stating that while the company is pushing ahead with its 5G rollout, he does not expect consumer devices to be available until at least the end of 2019. Berroeta declined to discuss VHA's spectrum ambitions for 5G in Australia, instead emphasizing the need to establish a new ""ecosystem"" for mobile technology before carriers start spruiking products. He predicted that the ""majority of the market"" will launch 5G within a one to two-month window when it becomes available."

He died in 1984 at the age of 80. ""We think Father Ciszek is a very special person who dedicated his life to serving God and the Church. His experiences in the Soviet Union were very difficult, but he never gave up his faith. He is a true hero and a model worth learning from."" The museum has many artifacts from Father Ciszek's life, including his clothes, books, and photos. These items allow people to better understand Father Ciszek's life and faith. The staff at the museum hope that through these exhibits, more people will learn about Father Ciszek's story and draw inspiration from his life."
"I was just reminded of why I abandoned a career in financial journalism, including my stint as a reporter on Wall Street, after 11 years in the saddle. While the financial world has its fascinations, I grew disillusioned with the dominant narrative that the financial world is always about the money, and not about other considerations such as values and social impact, which never appeared on the radar. It's not entirely surprising, given that trading floors are testosterone-filled and there's little connection between the lives of city executives and ordinary people."
"A report to be released on Tuesday will detail how an unknown cyber hacker breached computers in South Carolina and stole tax returns of millions of residents dating back several years. NBC's Michael Isikoff reports. Columbia, South Carolina - Last August, workers at the South Carolina Department of Revenue received a malicious email that allowed an international hacker to gain access to the state's computers and obtain 3.8 million tax returns, including social security numbers and bank account information. Experts say it's the largest cyber attack against a state government in history, according to details of the report to be released on Tuesday. According to the report, the attack was carried out through a phishing email, which gave the hacker permission to enter the state's computer system and steal a large amount of sensitive information."
"Syria: Why is Assad advancing? In the presidential election held in early June, Assad was declared the winner with 88.7% of the vote. Given the nature of the regime, this was not unexpected. However, despite the fact that these elections were by no means ""free"" and many people were unable to vote because they were in refugee camps outside the country's borders, the outcome suggests that a significant part of the population is supporting Assad. Why is this? Stop the criminal attacks on Gaza! Yesterday, the Israeli army launched a ground attack on Gaza."
"Butler made headlines last week for posting a signed letter from Barack Obama on her website, which described her as ""intelligent, wise and determined"". She later admitted that the words were coined by her staff and Obama had simply signed it. Before entering the Commons, Butler was an official with the GMB union. She replaced Paul Boateng as the MP for Brent South in 2005, becoming the third black woman to be an MP. In September 2008, she was promoted to her current position.

Is the performance in the fifth season of the Indian Premier League related to money, nationality, or age? Purnendu Maji and Srinivas Bhogle help us figure it out.

"BlackBerry Ltd. has decided not to renew a licensing agreement that allows T-Mobile US Inc. to sell its products. A promotional mishap last month led to the breakdown of the relationship between BlackBerry and T-Mobile after years of cooperation. On Wednesday, BlackBerry announced that it would not renew the licensing agreement to sell its products with T-Mobile, which is set to expire on April 25. In February, T-Mobile offended the Canadian smartphone manufacturer by sending a message to its BlackBerry users, offering them an iPhone 5s with no down payment.

"On November 17, 2015, at 12:55 a.m., Michael Hoppen had to change the habits he had formed in Manhattan. We realized that in Manhattan, the costs were too high for us. We searched everywhere and finally came to this area, where we found the houses to be stunning and had a great feel. The owners who sold us the house, Rodney and Desmond, lived next door. They had received several offers, and I think it's possible that they wanted us to be their neighbors - a couple expecting a child, wanting to buy their first home. I believe this may have been more attractive than paying an extra 0.1% down payment."

Shortly after the latter was acquired, he founded Transmit Security.

"Can drainage pipes resolve the compacting conflict. How can we introduce more water into the Republican River. Can this be achieved by retrofitting existing ranch dams with drainage pipes. 8 to 12 inch pipes can allow water from ranch dams to slowly drain out during rain events and flow into the Republican River. Note: This solution does not remove any ranch dams as they provide us with valuable services, but rather just retrofit them. The pipes can be set at a height that allows water to be retained for livestock, wildlife, and other species."

"Washington — South Florida has long been a testing ground for some of the nation's most intense politics, with opponents using tactics such as creating phantom candidates to siphon off votes from their rivals, or hiring so-called boleteras (ballot brokers) to illegally fill out large numbers of absentee ballots for elderly or disabled voters.

"I'd like to respond again to the audience's questions because we're just starting a lively discussion on how to ""save big."" Recently, on ""GMA Weekend"" and ABC News Now, I reported on how hiring a medical bill advocate can help you find and correct hospital bill errors, saving you thousands of dollars.

"Where America goes, Britain often follows, and this is particularly evident in the negative aspects. If America experiences extreme weather, we usually follow suit a few days later. If violent crime rates rise in America, they also do so here. And then there's the shopping frenzy.

Black Friday has just passed, and today is Cyber Monday, with each of these shopping days becoming an established part of the retail calendar on both sides of the Atlantic."

"As a veteran of the climate change activism movement, I have grown accustomed to disappointment. So, when I was summoned to the office of the Senior Associate to the President at Stanford University as the Organizing Coordinator for Stanford's ""Fossil Free Stanford"" organization, I attended the meeting with trepidation. My concerns were well-founded. Earlier that morning, Harvard University had arrested a student for demanding a public dialogue on fossil fuel divestment. Last fall, Brown University had flatly rejected students' calls to cut ties with the thirteen dirtiest coal companies. Efforts to implement climate policies at the national and international level had fared no better."

"The airline operates 744 mainline aircraft, of varying sizes, with a capacity of between 50 and 366 passengers. For a typical 737 aircraft carrying 179 passengers, this weight saving measure means a reduction of about 11 pounds per flight. According to the paper, stopping the sale of duty-free items on board, such as ""perfume, chocolates and alcohol"", also saved 1.4 million gallons of fuel per year, saving United Airlines $2.3 million. This assumes that this also meant that United Airlines was earning less than $2.3 million in revenue from selling these items on its aircraft, or that allowing passengers to buy these items on the ground would not have a significant impact on its revenue."

"The dispute between US intelligence agencies and its democratically elected President Donald Trump is not only peculiar but also a special case for assessing the principles that should guide the relationship between national intelligence and the political administrative branch under a democratic system. In theory, the national security system, based on intelligence, is responsible for detecting and tracking any threats to national security, whether external or internal, and works towards eliminating them. However, it operates under the authorization of the democratically elected political administrative branch, which is the ultimate holder of sovereignty. Under a democratic system, the political administrative branch is the ultimate embodiment and representative of national sovereignty. Therefore, the relationship between the national security system and the political administrative branch is complex and subtle, requiring a balance to be struck to ensure that the national security system can effectively fulfill its duties while also being subject to the supervision and restraint of the political administrative branch."

"Central American referee Carlos Batres put on the worst acting performance in the World Cup, performed by an Italian, the best actor since Federico Fellini, and thus denied New Zealand's All Whites a historic victory over the current world champions of football.

"My daughter is a residential advisor for her university, and recently mentioned that she might be getting more foreign exchange students to oversee in the fall, and made some complaining noises about it. When I asked her why this was a bad thing, she said that foreign exchange students tend to assume Americans are stupid unless they prove otherwise. They assume Americans don't travel as widely as they do, or speak foreign languages as fluently as they do, or know as much about world culture as they do. I said what any good American would say: why don't they just stay home? Oh, she replied, they don't think our universities are stupid."

Davis is dedicated to doing her part and working hard to help students thrive in middle school, and her efforts have received national recognition. She was a national semifinalist for the American School Counselor Association's School Counselor of the Year award in 2013 and won the award earlier this month."
"I strongly encourage the mayor and city council to continue moving forward with protecting the South Central Corridor. This is the only decision that upholds the will of the voters, does not jeopardize Federal Transportation Administration funding, and reinforces the value of the Phoenix light rail. Our leaders must remain consistent and continue to support this important project. This is the only wise course of action. Arizona has already approved all necessary health profession licensures to provide patients with an integrative approach to addressing chronic pain issues. It is now time for the health professions to work together in the best interest of the patient."

According to the law, a registered practitioner can only lawfully perform an abortion in New Zealand after obtaining a certificate approved by two advisors appointed by the Abortion Supervisory Committee. The appeal also argues that the court made a legal error in concluding that the committee can form its own opinion on the lawfulness of advisors' decisions to approve or decline abortions."

"Ricky Kalgard: You should be focusing on four areas. One is financial regulations, which still makes it difficult for small businesses to get loans. You mentioned healthcare regulations, Obamacare has increased the cost burden everywhere you look at it. Then there's environmental regulations, which is a broad field that's choking small businesses, especially in California where I live. California farmers are being squeezed in the name of protecting certain insects. And then you have labor regulations. Last year, we saw the National Labor Relations Board go after Boeing."
"To create a ""diversionary event"", foreign forces attacked Venezuela's key power plants, which ""have equipment made in Canada"", Maria Zakharova explained, the perpetrators were well aware of all the algorithms and vulnerabilities of the Venezuelan power grid. Venezuela has been experiencing nationwide blackouts since last week. President Nicolas Maduro called the blackouts ""sabotage"" and said they were orchestrated by the US. He said that several ""saboteurs"" who tried to disrupt the power grid had been detained. He had earlier accused Washington of plotting a coup against him, among other alleged subversive activities."
"Where were you when you received the 40 Under 40 award in 2009, I had already been working at Grubb & Ellis for nine years by then. In retrospect, I was still a young professional at that time, constantly honing my commercial real estate brokerage skills, building my expertise, and refining my client service.

Although it's not due until July, UK importers have shown their hand on pricing, announcing full specifications and prices more than three months ahead of the launch, clearly hoping that anyone considering purchasing a rival MPV, such as the Peugeot 807, Chrysler Voyager or Ford Galaxy, will wait to see what the Grandis has to offer."

Tacoma News Tribune reporter Matt Driscoll also made it to the rooftop, and he recently explained how the rooftop dance led to thousands of dollars in fines for his employer and the baseball team from the state's Department of Labor and Industries. But in a pile of public documents I finally obtained, there was an email from an individual - it helped provide a more complete answer."
"Recently, my elderly mother went to the bank at Eastland Shopping Center in West Covina. As she was leaving the bank, a woman carrying a baby approached her and asked for money for food, claiming that she had just arrived from Italy and had no money or means of support.

The woman thanked her and continued to beg from other people in the parking lot."

"Can you put a price on faith? This is the question being raised by churchgoers as the tradition of tithing - donating 10% of one's income to the church - is facing increasing challenges. Opponents of tithing argue that it is a misinterpretation of the Bible, a human invention rather than God's will. They believe they should have the freedom to choose the amount they donate, and are arguing with pastors, writing letters, and quitting the church in protest. In response, some pastors have changed their teachings and rejected a fundraising method that has been the most favored for decades."

Frankston knocked off last year's premiership contender Port Melbourne last week and withstood a strong Collingwood fightback on Saturday. Goosey said the key was getting players drafted into the AFL system, with Michael Hibberd, Dylan Van Unen and Mark Baguley now at Essendon, and Marcus Marigliani having been on the Bombers' list in 2011."

"Brazils Santa Maria - a band known for its pyrotechnic performances on stage may have caused a fire at a nightclub in southern Brazil due to cost-cutting measures, resulting in the deaths of over 230 people. State police inspector Marcelo Arigony, who is leading the investigation into the deadly fire over the weekend, told reporters at a press conference on Tuesday that the band members knowingly purchased flares meant for outdoor use because they cost only $1.25 each, while indoor flares cost $35.

"Several bills in the New Jersey State House have garnered the attention of truckers and other road users in the state. Repeat drunk driving offenders may soon face stricter penalties. Current New Jersey law only limits punishment for affected offenders to a traffic offense. Bail is typically set at $2,500. The designation as a traffic offense allows drivers charged with drunk driving to continue driving while awaiting their court date. A bill awaiting assembly in the state legislature aims to put an end to this practice. Instead, A3057 would increase penalties for those convicted of drunk driving two or more times within 60 days, designating it as a fourth-degree crime."

"Why is a provocative Dutch journalist on the payroll of a former Alaska governor's political action committee? An investigation by Mother Jones magazine. Over the past few months, Sarah Palin's political action committee, SarahPAC, has paid out thousands of dollars to a mysterious company that has gone to great lengths to conceal its ownership. The addresses associated with the company point to maildrops. It has no website. No phone number. Even a lawyer in California doesn't know who is behind the company. But an investigation by Mother Jones magazine has found that the company is run by an unlikely foreign political operative."
"Carillon Beach - for Lea and Andy Meyer, living a natural lifestyle comes naturally, and their sunrise market and cafe are just an extension of that lifestyle. ""I love how friendly everyone is here, the culture is really interesting. I also love the beaches and the sunshine,"" Lea said on Thursday as she made pancakes from scratch at the cafe. She and Andy moved to the coastal town from the Northern California area in February. The Meyers have been welcomed by the Carillon Beach community, opening their cafe on March 21 and organizing the Carillon Beach farmers market this summer."
"The Bible teaches, ""Resist the devil and he will flee from you"" (James 4:7). It also tells us to stay away from those who are led by all kinds of evil desires (see 1 Timothy 3:5-6). Many who were great in God's eyes have fallen into the temptations of the flesh and possibly destroyed their lives and ministries. Someone has said, ""It takes a lifetime to build integrity, but only a minute to lose it."" This is a true statement! I believe one of the main reasons leaders fall is that most have never intentionally built a firewall in their minds and emotions."

"The band Led Zeppelin plagiarized from the 60's band Spirit? ""The Voice"" plagiarized from ""American Idol""? In a recent lawsuit, the estate of the composer of the song ""Taurus"" claimed that ""Stairway To Heaven"" infringed on copyright law. Creators have been borrowing from each other for centuries. But what is the real harm - financial, artistic, or otherwise? How much of the original work is transplanted into the new work? That's always the murky part. Music copyright lawsuits have been going on for over a century."
"The detailed upgrade process, hopefully it will be helpful to you if you don't have this experience before. Let me be in charge of disassembling the screws on the back, be careful with the keyboard sliding connection to the blue connector, gently pull it out. Disassemble the back again, start to disassemble the screws. Take out the back rack. Now start replacing the solid-state drive. It's great, the solid-state drive matches the slot perfectly. Tighten the screws to secure the solid-state drive. Evaluate the performance of the solid-state drive, it surprised me again, scoring 7.8. As far as I know, the highest score is 7.9."

"The following is written by Katrine Øgaard Jensen, one of the founding editors of EuropeNow, a journal of politics, literature, and art at Columbia University. She previously served as editor-in-chief of Columbia Journal and blog editor of Asymptote and Words Without Borders. If Baudelaire were alive to read the work of Alejandra Pizarnik, it would have given him nightmares. Pizarnik is revered by writers such as Octavio Paz, Roberto Bolaño, and César Aira, the latter of whom has called her the ""greatest and most extreme"" poet - one of the most important contributors to 20th-century Argentine poetry."
"Albion striker Simon Cox has emerged as a transfer target for Championship club Derby County. Rams boss Nigel Clough has been keeping close tabs on the 23-year-old and will consider a loan move if he gets any encouragement from The Hawthorns. Sources in the East Midlands confirmed today that the former Reading and Swindon player has been identified by Clough as a potential target as he looks to bolster his attacking options. The Pride Park boss is also understood to be keen on Scunthorpe's highly-rated Gary Hooper, Sheffield United's Billy Sharp and Everton's James Vaughan, who he took on loan last season."
"The gymkhana videos shot by Ken Block are extremely stunning. However, the New South Wales Police did not want Ken Block to shoot this particular gymkhana video in Sydney - the one you see above. The Hoonigan team turned to New York instead, leaving Australia behind. Here is the video they shot - which could have featured the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Opera House and our most famous iconic landmarks. Ken Block's Gymkhana Nine was shot in conjunction with the release of the Forza Horizon 3 video game, which had Australia as its backdrop - so it made sense for Gymkhana Nine to be shot in Australia."

"The photos of Yemen we published may be the most disturbing we have ever published. Here's why we decided to publish them. Amal Hussein, a 7-year-old Yemeni girl, with a haunting gaze, appeared in our recent reporting from Yemen, a country at war and on the brink of famine. Amal is skeletal, her head turned to one side, as if she cannot bear to look directly at the person staring at her. Some readers may feel the same impulse to look away."
"Ballyhooly 4-17 Castlelyons 1-12: On Saturday evening, in the Cork premier senior club intermediate hurling championship quarter-final, Ballyhooly produced a sensational second-half display to comprehensively defeat Castlelyons. With the outstanding Danny O'Callaghan and the support of five Cork intermediate panellists, the Carrigdhoun side showed many qualities that could quickly propel them back to senior grade. While the forwards will grab the headlines, O'Callaghan's display and the solidity of the half-back line ignited their second-half onslaught, which yielded 2-11 (2-10 from play)."
"US trade policy has become the top concern for chief financial officers, according to CNBC's quarterly survey. About two-thirds of chief financial officers in North America and the Asia-Pacific region said that US trade policy would have a negative impact on their companies over the next six months. Seven of the 16 largest declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average this year were triggered by trade concerns. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin headed to Capitol Hill on Thursday to face questioning from the House Financial Services Committee on trade, tariffs, and the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mnuchin attempted to alleviate growing uncertainty in Congress as President Trump escalates the trade war with China."
"January 29, 2015: Follow the money. One reason the new peace talks are making progress is that the factions in charge of most of the population are willing to make concessions if it will help halt the rapid decline in the standard of living nationwide. The fighting between factions, especially the two governments that claim to rule the whole country, has caused economic activity to shrink and shortages to increase. Then there is the violence from Islamic terrorism. While most Libyans are grateful for the help Islamic terror groups provided in 2011 to overthrow Kaddafi, since then these groups have become a greater menace than Kaddafi's secret police ever were."
